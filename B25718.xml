            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO <hi>ERASMUS SMITH, Of</hi> Weald-Hall <hi>in the County of</hi> Essex, <hi>Esq.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have made bold to prefix Your NAME to <hi>The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Famous Cardinal de RICHLIEƲ,</hi> and hope the Dignity of the Subject will, in some manner, atone for all the Failures of the Translation. That Eminent Person, whose Principal Actions it relates, was One of the most Able Ministers which this Part of the World has produc'd for many Ages; and to his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conduct <hi>France</hi> is indebted for the Formidable Grandeur it now enjoys; which all the United Forces of <hi>Europe,</hi> with so much Pains and Expence, endeavour to depress. He first put a stop to all
<pb facs="tcp:187699:3"/> Her intestine Broils, which made Her incapable of looking abroad, by cutting off all those Sources which used to feed the Rebellious Humours before: He first laid the Foundation of Her Greatness at Sea, revived the Discipline of Her Armies, and secured as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged Her Frontiers on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. And as for those Rival Nations about Her, which were in a Situation to dispute the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty with Her, or to disturb Her Repose, He either humbled them by Force of Arms, or by his industrious Emissaries so embarass'd their Affairs at home, that they were not in a Condition to annoy Her. 'Tis true indeed, the People were Gainers under his Ministry, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Monarchy got by it, and that the Station he possess'd was not agreeable to one of the Ecclesiastick Character. It must likewise be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that he help'd to dissolve
<pb facs="tcp:187699:3"/> the ancient Constitution of his Country, in the room of which he introdued an Unlimited Power; that he ruin'd the Authority of the Nobless, by obliging them to a precarious Dependance upon the Crown, and that he too often sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to his Ambition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. However, such was his happy Fate or his Dexterity, that he weather'd all the Storms that so often threatned him; and though he had a jealous Master to manage, whose dark and distrustful Temper gave him no small difficulty, yet he died in the greatest Reputation with him, that ever Subject did with his Prince. What particularly deserves to be remarked in him, is that amidst a thousand other Cares and Distractions, he found leisure to encourage Learning, and to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the <hi>French</hi> Language and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, with so much success, as to render them in a manner as Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb facs="tcp:187699:4"/> as he projected their Monarchy.</p>
            <p>As for this History, in part Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated by me, it comprehends the most remarkable Occurrences of Christendom, during the whole time of the Cardinal's sitting at the Helm; in all which he had a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable share; and as he was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly superiour to his contemporary Ministers, always managed to his Master's Advantage.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis a just Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most Translators, That they affect to be as partial to their Authors, as Lovers are to their Mistresses; that they not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow abundance of good Qualities upon them, which the rest of the World are not able to discover, and often over-value what is really com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in them, but either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Defects, or else labour to set them off for so many Beauties, with Strains of false Rhetorick. However, I think I may safely
<pb facs="tcp:187699:4"/> affirm, without the least preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in favour of our Historian, That his Language is Easie and Unaffected; his Narration is no where clogged with impertinent Digressions; nor swell'd into a tiresom Prolixity with nauseous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions; nor does it languish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a tedious <hi>detail</hi> of idle Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. His Reflections all along are Solid, Just, and Instructive, and show him to be a Man of Honour and Sincerity, one that was well acquainted with the World, and passionately concerned for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liberties and Wellfare of <hi>France.</hi> For which Reason we find him frequently reproaching the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, with ruining the Power of Parliaments; which in all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kingdoms that were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Northern People upon the Ruines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had, according to the different Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Climate, a greater or
<pb facs="tcp:187699:5"/> lesser Share in the publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration; and yet, on the other Hand, he is not backward to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Services, when they apparently tended to the Interest of his Country. Except where he touches upon our <hi>English</hi> Affairs, and unjustly represents King <hi>Charles</hi> the First as inclin'd to Popery, he is Impartial in every thing he says: But we may easily forgive this single Slip in a Foreigner, who might be misled as to that Particular, by some late Memoirs of our own Writers, who have treated the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that unhappy Monarch with equal Insolence and Malice. He never expresses his Resentments at the expence of Truth; but as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the Vices of our Minister with great freedom, so he makes no difficulty to celebrate his Vertues.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have presumed to lay before You the Design and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this Performance; and tho'
<pb facs="tcp:187699:5"/> the World will justly tax me for dwelling so long upon this Article; yet of Two Evils, I rather chose to trespass upon Your Patience, than to offend Your Modesty, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, after the received custom of Dedications, to attempt Your Panegyrick: Unless that Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion kept me back, here is a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation that is not easily overcome. Your Extraction from the Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ancient Family of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz,</hi> a Name sufficiently known in our <hi>English</hi> Baronage; Your obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Deportment and Generosity; Your early Acquaintance with the <hi>Belles Lettres;</hi> and, to crown all, so just a Knowledge of Mankind in so much Youth; by which you have already given the World an earnest of what Your Country and Your Friends may justly expect from Your maturer Years, are such fruitful Topicks, that 'tis almost as difficult to abstain from a pursuit
<pb facs="tcp:187699:6"/> of them, as 'tis to find them so happily joyned in any single Person. But I am conscious to my self that I have sufficiently incurr'd Your Displeasure, by drawing You out of Your beloved Retirement with this Publick Address; and therefore shall take care not to inflame the Reckoning, by engaging in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which after all, I am unfit to manage. All I pretend to, is to divert Your vacant Hours, when Your Friends and Affairs of greater Importance will permit You to take up with so sorry an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to declare to the World with what Zeal and Sincerity I am,</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Generality of those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom I have hitherto seen, that have attempted the History of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> only seem to have propos'd one of these Two Ends to themselves; either they took Pen in Hand to render him odious, and blacken his Memory, or else writ with a design to make his Panegyric. Very few of them have observ'd the just Decorum, where the Evil and the Good is impartially related, without endeavouring to exaggerate, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate one more than the other. I shall not here give my self the trouble to cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticize upon the Panegyrists of this Prelate, nor to examine those Persons that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Satyrs against him. Those that question my Sincerity, and doubt the truth of what I relate, may, for their greater Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they please, consult the Authors out
<pb facs="tcp:187699:7"/> of whom I have borrow'd my Memoirs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis necessary I should acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before I proceed any farther, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign I propos'd to my self in writing this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, and what Laws I intended religiously to observe in the whole course of it.</p>
            <p>As I was easily convinced that the better part of my Memoirs were only to be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Sources, which generally speaking, were poison'd, or from the most abject Strains of Flattery, I thought my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take great care to distinguish Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, barely consider'd in themselves, from the manner in which they were related. And this I endeavour'd to do, by comparing several Historians together, to see in what Particulars they agree; which I look upon to be the Truth of History, at least as far as we are able at any distance to discover it. These Facts being once established, we may then proceed to judge of abundance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular things, without running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great danger of losing the Truth out of sight. There are some Actions which may be indifferent in themselves, or come from a Principle worthy of Commendation, if the Authors of them were animated by a Spirit of Justice and Equity; which on the other Hand are bad, when the Motive that produc'd them is of that nature. Upon this score I believ'd it necessary to form to
<pb facs="tcp:187699:7"/> my self a true Idea of the Cardinal's Genius, by a strict Examination of his principal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his constant Conduct, in which both those that blame and those that praise him equally concur. Upon the strength of this Idea I have judged of the Motives which seem to have influenced him on several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, where, without that help it would be a difficult matter to come to any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive determination. And this is the way follow'd by all the World, when they give themselves the trouble to find out the true Reasons of Actions, which, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready observed, may be either Good or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, according to the Principle from whence they come: Nor is this Conduct by any means to be censured, if Passion and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice do not mingle with it. Thus, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, a Man who is universally known both by his Discourses as well as his Actions, to be vindicative in his Temper, if he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to crush another that has injur'd him, ought not to complain if People say that he did it out of a Spirit of Revenge. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Passion, (and Persons of great Souls are seldom without one) especially when it appears too strong for the rest; although a Man takes never so much care to conceal it, yet it tinctures the whole Scene of his Life; and when this is once discover'd by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Indications, the World is seldom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb facs="tcp:187699:8"/> when they pass a Judgment upon his Actions.</p>
            <p>This is the Rule which I have follow'd in the whole Series of this History, where I have given every thing that turn, which the constant and perpetual Character of the Cardinal requir'd; though at the same time I have not prevaricated in any Events what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, nor disguis'd the Truth upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. The Reader will soon find out what was the true Character of our Prelate, by reading his Life, but he may read the Abridgement of it at the end of this Work.</p>
            <p>I have made use of several Historians who flourish'd at the same time, whom I have generally cited all along in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, when I borrow'd any particular Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from them, which are not to be met with in other Authors. But the Two principal Writers, out of whom I have extracted this History, are <hi>Lewis Aubery,</hi> who has writ the Cardinal's Life in <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Vittorio Siri,</hi> who has made an Abridgement of it in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> in the Third Book of the Second Tome of his <hi>Mercurio,</hi> and who likewise has handled it more at large in his <hi>Memorie Recondite,</hi> where he recounts all the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Occcurences that fell out yearly, so long as the Cardinal continu'd in the Ministry.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:187699:8"/>
            <p> The first is an insupportable fulsom Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, who would fain sham the Cardinal upon the World for a Holy Pious Man, that possess'd all the Episcopal Virtues in as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Degree, as he did the several Talents of a Minister of State. He generally dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles every thing that may in the least wound the Reputation of this Minister; and, on the other Hand, amplifies and exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerates every Occasion that may tend to his Honour; or, to express my self more properly, he is his Advocate, and pleads the cause of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to persuade his Judges, that is to say, his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, That he was a Bishop of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable Life, and a Minister without fault. Every thing the Cardinal says or does, could neither be better said or done, if you will believe <hi>Aubery.</hi> He was a Man without Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and without Vices, who always acted upon Principles wholly divested of Interest, which only tended to the publick advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the State, and the Glory of the King.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Siri,</hi> on the other hand, very freely describes both his Vertues and Vices; he does not diminish from the Lustre of his good Actions; neither does he set a Veil before his bad ones. But as he only propos'd to make a Collection of Memoirs, he is far from being
<pb facs="tcp:187699:9"/> uniform, for he enlarges more or less upon the several things he recounts, according as his Collections were of a greater or smaller bulk. To this we may add, that he slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passes over many remarkable Actions, because others had given printed Relations of them before him, and he chiefly busies himself to lay open those Negotiations which had never appear'd in publick. He had read the Dispatches of several Nuncio's who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Residents from the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in the same Court, which he cites every Moment, as well as the Letters of several Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors from that Crown to the Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which never saw the Light. Thus we find in this Author abundance of particular Matters of Fact, which are not to be met with elsewhere. He likewise gives us several Negotiations of the Cardinal with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Pope, and other Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which discover the true Genius of this Minister infinitely better than a simple Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which other Historians have made of them. 'Tis indeed certain, that <hi>Siri</hi> is not methodical enough; but as his Design was to collect Memoirs, not only for the History of <hi>France,</hi> but also for that of all <hi>Europe</hi> besides, it was not easie for him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid Confusion, and frequent Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in so vast a Collection. We have likewise a just occasion to complain of him,
<pb facs="tcp:187699:9"/> for altering and disguising the greatest part of the Proper Names of Cities and Men, except only those of <hi>Italy,</hi> a <note n="*" place="margin">If our Historian quarrels with the <hi>Italian</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for altering the proper Names of Men and Places, I am sure we have as much, if not more, reason to tax the <hi>French</hi> with the same Fault, as any one may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that will read <hi>Moreri, Raguenet</hi>'s Life of <hi>Cromwell;</hi> or, in short, any of their Geographers and Historians that pretend to relate our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> defect which the best Authors of his Country, may be justly charged with, who write those Names just as they pronounce them, that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ill.</p>
            <p>However, to do Justice to <hi>Siri,</hi> and not to be ungrateful to an Author to whom I have been so exceedingly indebted, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that as he was Master of many great Qualifications, so he was furnish'd with mighty Helps to write his History; and I must ingenuously own, that I have drawn more Matters of Fact from him, than from any other Historian whom I have consulted. I have scarce consulted any of the Protestant Authors upon these Matters; because, as very few of that Party have writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, so it was not worth the while to read them all. They may reasonably enough be suspected to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd against the Cardinal, who ruin'd their Affairs in <hi>France.</hi> Therefore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may observe that for the greatest part I cite none but Catholick Authors, though I do not joyn with them in the great Elogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
<pb facs="tcp:187699:10"/> they bestow upon the Cardinal for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving destroy'd the Rights and Privileges of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> As I never design'd to engage my self in a controversial War, but only to recount Matters of State, I have wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined my self to the pure Idea's of Policy, or, at least, to those Sentiments that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both Religions.</p>
            <p>By the Word <hi>Policy</hi> (to deliver my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once for all) I do not understand the Art of advancing ones own Affairs, or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing ones Prince, by any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether agreeable to Equity or not; but the Art of rendring the Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple equally happy under a certain form of Government, by those steady Methods which Prudence and Justice prescribe to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This is the just and true Idea which those great Men that first writ of <hi>Politicks</hi> have given us of this Science, which made up one part of their <hi>Morality,</hi> and which they had formed upon those Lights and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices which all the Nations in the World possess in common. In these latter Ages indeed some Authors have defin'd it to be an Art to satisfie the Ambition, Revenge, and Avarice of Sovereign Princes, without having any regard to Justice, or the good of the People. As by introducing this new mysterious Science they have endeavour'd to procure the Favour of those Persons who
<pb facs="tcp:187699:10"/> make use of it, and to have some share in those Advantages which they derive from it; so they have suited and accommodated all their Histories to these Maxims, only designing their own proper Advancement, by fitting themselves to the Gusto and Relish of those from whom they expect a Reward. As for my self, who had never any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in my Thoughts, I have all along fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Idea's of the ancient <hi>Policy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any manner of recompence or advantage in my Eye. I have fairly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Truth as far as I knew it, and have not impos'd my own Inventions upon the World, as the Reader may easily satisfie himself, if he pleases to examine my Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and compare this History with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have handled the same Argument before me. I have disguised nothing out of Passion, or to please any Faction or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I have extenuated nothing, or amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to the receiv'd Rules of History. In short, I do not find my self in the least guilty of any breach relating to that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and impartial Temper, which those that have laid down the everlasting Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of this Art, require in an Historian, when he sets himself to write.</p>
            <p>All that can with any pretence be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in my Conduct is, that I have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon abundance of things which
<pb facs="tcp:187699:11"/> might have been related in a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, without being tiresome to the Reader, and that I have not set down every thing that might have been said in so fertile and copious a Subject, as the Life of this Cardinal really is. But to this I answer, That to satisfie Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of such a relish, instead of Two Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the bigness of these which I have published, a Man ought at least to have composed Ten or Twelve. Out of a great multitude of Occurrences which might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enough enter into the Life of the Cardinal, I have selected and chosen only those that more particularly concern the Cardinal's Person: These have I related more at large; others, which seem'd absolutely necessary, I referr'd to the end of this Narration. To conclude all in a Word, to have taken in all the particulars that relate to his Life, one must have made a compleat History of <hi>France</hi> from the Year 1624, to the Year 1642; during which time the Cardinal govern'd that Kingdom much more than the Prince whose Minister he was. But the limits of a Life do not extend so far as those of a general Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and though both one and the other be read with Pleasure, yet I was resolved that this Work should fully answer the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle which I had given it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:187699:11"/>
            <p> I thought it convenient at the end of this Preface to set down the <hi>Treaty of Madrid,</hi> concerning the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline:</hi> For though I have mention'd it more than once, yet I omitted to relate the particulars of it, because the Cardinal was not received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ministry at the time when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Nevertheless, 'tis necessary for the better understanding several Passages of his Life.</p>

            <head>THE TREATY of <hi>MADRID, Drawn out of the Embassie of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal</hi> de Bassompierre <hi>in</hi> Spain.</head>
            <p>TOwards the end of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year 1621. <hi>Francis de Bassompierre,</hi> Knight of the Holy Ghost, one of his Majesty's Privy-Counsellors, and Colonel-General of the <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> having been sent from the part of the King into <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Quality of his Ambassador Extraordinary, to treat with the Catholick King concerning the restitution of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> to its former Condition, by reason of the Interests which oblig'd his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Majesty to preserve the <hi>Grisons</hi> in the possession of their Country, he found his Catholick Majesty dangerously sick; so that he cou'd not execute his Commission <hi>vivâ voce.</hi> Having given his Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and set down in writing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Heads of his Commission, the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Death of his Catholick Majesty was the reason why that Prince cou'd not put in execution the good Intentions he had to restore the <hi>Valteline,</hi> according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb facs="tcp:187699:12"/> of the most Christian King; and that the rather because his Holiness at the same time, by a particular Brief, made very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Instances to have it perform'd: But his Catholick Majesty dying, left the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Article, among the other Clauses, annex'd to his Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forasmuch as on the 27th. of</hi> March <hi>of this present Year, I received a Letter from the hand of his Holiness</hi> Gregory <hi>XV. wherein he exhorts me, That in consideration of himself, and out of a due regard to the Publick Welfare, I should think of accommodating the Affair of the</hi> Valteline: <hi>And to remove all occasion of Scandal which might thereupon happen, I order the most Serene Prince, and my most Dear Son, to follow herein the Paternal Advice of his Holiness, in the Form above-mention'd, since my chief Intention was only to act in behalf of the Publick Good, and for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Catholicks of that Valley, the care of which belongs to his Holiness, as Ʋniversal Father of the Church. My Pleasure is, That this Writing may be look'd upon to be a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Clause of my Will, as if it had been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comprehended in that Article, wherein I command that all the Papers that appear to be Signed in my Name, be judged and esteemed to be parts of my Will.</hi> Made at our Royal Palace at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the 30th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1621.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:187699:13"/>
            <p> Don <hi>Philip</hi> IV. immediately after his coming to the Crown, resolv'd fully to accomplish that which the King, his Lord and Father, order'd him to see perform'd, that which his Holiness desir'd for the common Tranquility, as likewise his most Christian Majesty demanded of him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to what he was oblig'd by his Royal Word, given to the Lords of the three Leagues.

               <head type="sub">Containing the most remarkable Passages of his Life, from his Birth to the Year 1624. when he was the second time made a Counsellor of State.</head>
               <p>IF ever there was a Publick Minister who in his time furnished Matter for the most envenomed Satyrs, and yet from other Hands received the most extravagant Praises, 'tis assuredly <hi>Armand John Du Plessis, Cardinal of Richlieu,</hi> whose Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I now attempt to write. He is on one side accused of Ambition, of Cruelty, of Perfidiousness, and, in short, of all the Crimes by which Ambitious Statesmen use to support their Authority. 'Tis said, that he either entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruin'd <hi>France</hi> himself, or put the Ministers that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in a condition to effect it. Others, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, look upon him to have been a skilful Pilot, whom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:187699:17"/> the happy Genius of his Country bestowed upon the State, when it was dangerously tossed with violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, and to whom it was indebted for the Tranquillity it afterwards enjoy'd. These People maintain, that he alone first made it appear how formidable the Forces of <hi>France</hi> were, if they were managed to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that he laid the most solid Foundations of its Greatness. After all, perhaps these Judgments, so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in appearance, are not so difficult to be reconciled, as one would imagine at first sight: Nay, I dare venture to affirm, that the Reader will find this Paradox so fully made out in the Series of this History, that what here seems a Contradiction, will become as evident as the plainest Truth whatever.</p>
               <p>His Father was <hi>Francis du Plessis,</hi> the fourth of that Name, <hi>Lord of Richlieu, Beçai, Chillou,</hi> and <hi>Vervoliere,</hi> descended from an ancient Family in <hi>Poitou;</hi> and his Mother's Name was <hi>Frances de la Porte. Francis du Plessis</hi> follow'd the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> and came back with him from thence. He was made Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost of <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1575, and Eleven Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Knight of the Holy Ghost.</hi> He was also much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who in 1590. made him Captain of his Guards; but he never lived to take Possession of that Post, dying soon after.

                  <hi>Armand John du Plessis</hi> was born at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Year 1585. on the fifth of <hi>September.</hi> His Father dying Five Years after, he was educated under the Care of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Prior of St. <hi>Florent</hi> instructed him in the first Rudiments of Learning: He was afterwards sent to the Colledge of <hi>Navar;</hi> from whence he quickly removed to that of <hi>Lisieux,</hi> where he went through a Course of Philosophy. From this last place he pass'd to the Academy, to learn to ride the Great Horse, and perform the other Exercises proper for a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was design'd for the War. At this time he wore a Sword, and assum'd the Title of <hi>Lord de Chillou;</hi> but soon alter'd his Design. His Brother <hi>Alphonsus du Plessis,</hi> who had been nominated to the Bishoprick of <hi>Luçon,</hi> quitted it, and shut himself up in a Cloyster of <hi>Carthusians:</hi> But his Relations thinking it was their Interest to preserve that Bishoprick in the Family, procured the King's Mandamus in favour of <hi>Armand John,</hi> who upon this changed his Secular Habit for a Cassock, and began to study Divinity. His Family, which had no extraordinary Estate belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, look'd upon this Bishoprick as an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Support. After he had spent some time in his Studies, he maintain'd his Theses in the Episcopal Habit, as being already a Bishop Elect, and received his Doctor of Divinity's Cap with the general Applause of those that heard him: But he did not sit down satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with these Formalities, which rather discover vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Wit than any true Knowledge; for he resolv'd heartily to apply himself to all the Studies necessary for a Bishop. To accomplish this, he retired to a Country House near <hi>Paris,</hi> with a Doctor of <hi>Lovain,</hi> who was to direct him in his Studies, where he spent Two entire Years, and employ'd Eight Hours a Day in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He particularly apply'd himself to <hi>Polemic</hi> Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; by which he saw Cardinal <hi>du Perron</hi> had acquir'd a mighty Reputation, and so hop'd to advance his own Fortunes by the same way. However, by what one may judge of his Abilities in this kind, by a Treatise which goes under his Name, he was none of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Persons to manage Controversial Points; and he was but slenderly acquainted with his own Talent, if he ever
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:187699:18"/> expected to raise his Fortune this way. So some of his best Friends disswaded him from pursuing these Studies; by which, as it was not likely for him to raise his Credit, so they extremely preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd his Health. In the mean time he sent to the <note place="margin">1606.</note> Pope to grant him a Dispensation for his Age; and the King recommended this Affair to Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to <hi>D' Alencourt</hi> his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador.</p>
               <p>The Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> found it was his best way at last to go and sollicite this Affair for himself; and being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Rome▪</hi> had Audience of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. who, as 'tis said, was strangely pleas'd with his Conversation, and complied with his Desires in dispensing with his Age. * Nevertheless the Report runs, That he assur'd the <note place="margin">

Several Noble Persons who had been excluded from bearing any part in the Publick Affairs, under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. now endeavour'd to get in, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all manner of Artifices to accomplish their Designs. The Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> Superintendant of the Finances, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:187699:18"/> Grand Master of the Artillery, in whom <hi>Henry</hi> reposed a mighty Confidence upon the account of his great Qualities, was envy'd by a world of People. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Sillery, Villeroy</hi> Secretary of State, and <hi>Jeannin</hi> the President, combin'd against him to establish their own Authority: Besides these, the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> for some private Grudge, <hi>Concino,</hi> because he eclips'd his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fortunes, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> not only instigated by others, but because the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> had advis'd <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to apprehend him before he could make his Escape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> who envy'd him for the great Interest he had among the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> caball'd against him. All these Persons earnestly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd to ruin his Reputation with the Queen, for his morose parsimonious Temper; in which last particular he was directly opposite to that Princess, who loved to be liberal even to Profuseness. And she on the other hand being desirous to secure her own Authority, on which Consideration the Pope's Favour was absolutely necessary to her, found she must never expect to gain it, so long as she intrusted a <hi>Hugonot</hi> with the Adminstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Affairs. For this Reason she turn'd him out of all his Places, and oblig'd him to leave the Court.</p>
               <p>At this time the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> having sole Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1611"/> of the Queen's Favour, and fearing least the Grandees should unite to ruin him, endeavour'd to raise and foment Divisions between them. He dexterously manag'd the hatred which different Parties had one for another, and as far as in him lay balanc'd their Power, out of a consideration, that if one of these Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons destroy'd the other, it would be his own Fate to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same weight. This Project succeeded so well with him, that the Princes of the Blood, and those of the House of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> besides their publick Broils, had several other private ones which help'd to keep them at a distance. As none of them were any longer concern'd for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, nor the Glory of <hi>France,</hi> and the Royal Dignity was despis'd under the King's Minority, they all agreed in nothing else but pursuing their own private Interests. Things were in this Condition, when the Queen, to strengthen her Regence, and secure her self of a Peace, concluded a Marriage between her Son
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:187699:19"/>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. and the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> and between one of his Sisters and the Catholick King.</p>
               <p>These Marriages gave the Grandees an Opportunity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1612"/> to set all in Confusion, under pretence that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the true Interest of the Kingdom. The Countess of <hi>Soissons,</hi> and the Dutchess of <hi>Nevers,</hi> could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extreme regret behold how much the Princesses of <hi>Conty</hi> and <hi>Guise</hi> were in the Queen's Favour, and therefore engag'd their Lovers and Relations to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Party which opposed the Regence. Thus a Faction was form'd, of which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd himself Chief, because the Queen had refus'd him the Government of the Castle of <hi>Trompette.</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> was the Man that caball'd the most, and yet was the least suspected by the Regent. He cunningly wrought upon the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> and several others to leave the Court, but was himself the last that quitted it; and then he did it with the Queen's Consent. Immediately the whole Party broke out, <hi>Britany</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Picardy</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> the <hi>Isle of France</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Soissons</hi> and <hi>Noyon</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of <hi>Mayenne, Laon</hi> under the Marquiss <hi>de Caeuvres;</hi> and several other Cities and Provinces open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declar'd against the Regence; and this Faction was in a condition to act before the Queen knew that it was form'd against her.</p>
               <p>Thus the Malecontents meeting from all Parts, found themselves ready arm'd, before there were any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1613"/> Troops to oppose them; and their Design seem'd to be so much the more plausible, because they spoke of nothing but the Publick Good, and only pretended to put a few <hi>Italians,</hi> who had intruded into the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Affairs, out of a capacity of ruining the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. At this Juncture the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Queen, wherein he pray'd her to assemble the States of the Kingdom, to obviate the growing Disorders; and that Princess being not able to bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether more than Ten thousand Foot and Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse; and fearing least the Party of Malecontents should daily encrease, thought it the surest way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate Matters with them as soon as she might. For
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:187699:19"/> this end, she impower'd the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Treaty with them in her Name, and to settle all Differences as he should see convenient: It was agreed, That <hi>Amboise</hi> should be given to the Prince, St. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and a good Summ of Money to the Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon:</hi> So that the Principal Heads finding themselves satisfied as to their own particular, talk'd no more of the Publick Good.</p>
               <p>The King being out of his Minority, it was now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1614"/> thought expedient to convene the Estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to gain him the Affection of his Subjects, and prevent all manner of Troubles. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> us'd all his Interest to get such Deputies elected, as had a dependance upon him: However, the fear of being ill us'd at Court, and the hopes of a Recompence, which are as it were the Two Poles upon which all Human Actions turn, retain'd the greatest part of them in their Duty; so that the Prince was oblig'd to give up <hi>Amboise,</hi> notwithstanding all the Cabals he maintain'd to hinder it. The Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> who thought of nothing more than how to get himself in some Office, was one of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives of the Clergy, and had a Commission to present a Paper to the King, at the breaking up of the Estates. At the delivery of it, he made a Speech of an hour and half long, which was hearken'd to with a great deal of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was afterwards printed. There are two things in this Harangue, which it was observ'd he mention'd rather for his own Advantage, than for the Good of the Kingdom: One was, That he desir'd the King to leave the Administration of Affairs to the Queen his Mother, hoping perhaps to get some share in them by her Favour. The other was a severe Complaint he made, That there were no Church-men in the King's Council; as if the State could not be manag'd without their Concurrence and Advice. 'Tis true indeed, the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nothing that was new in this, and that Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks have been frequently concern'd in the Government; but, to the bottom, 'tis not of absolute necessity they should be there; and 'tis as plain a case, That a Man cannot at the same time discharge the Office of a good Bishop, and that of a Minister of State: Either of these Functions will take up a Man's whole Time; and in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:187699:20"/> truth 'tis impossible to divide ones self honestly between so many Cares. But our Bishop was of the Opinion, no doubt on't, That a Prelate who is employ'd by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might leave the Care of his Flock to a Vicar, that so himself might be more at leisure to attend the Affairs of the State. After all, the Question is, Whether the Gospel allows it; and whether those that look after the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, ought not in equity to have the Name and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of that Employment which they manage for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But 'tis a long while ago since it has been out of fashion to consult the Gospel, upon these Cases espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
               <p>Although the Grandees had no farther occasion now to complain, yet finding no means to satisfie their restless Ambition in times of Tranquillity, they sought an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to raise new Commotions. The Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> once more made use of that Ascendant which he had over the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> to engage him in fresh Designs. Those Persons also that were not satisfied with what had pass'd in the Assembly of the Estates, complain'd in all Companies, That they had taken Measures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the Welfare of the Kingdom: That it was not reasonable that the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> should be permitted to do what he pleas'd; and, That several of the Deputies had just Reasons to complain.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which had frequently inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested themselves in the Government of the State, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1615"/> an <hi>Arrest,</hi> by which they invited the Grandees, and all that were well-affected to their own Country, to join with them to redress the Abuses and Grievances that daily encreas'd: But the King, or rather the Council, put forth a Declaration, by which they annull'd this Arrest of Parliament; and prohibited all Persons, under severe Penalties, to concern themselves with these Affairs. The Parliament netled at this haughty Procedure, to which at that time they were not so well accustom'd as since, dispatch'd a Remonstrance to the King, wherein they treated him with a great deal of freedom; and advis▪d him, among other things, not to make use of * <hi>Absolute</hi>

                  <hi>Commands,</hi> in the First Year of his Majority. At the same time the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> dispers'd some Manifesto's in the form of Letters; wherein he gave the People to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:187699:20"/> understand, That those that complain'd of the present Government, had no other design than only to depress the too great Power of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre;</hi> to remove Grievances; to hinder the Marriages the Queen had concluded with <hi>Spain;</hi> and to restore the King and the Crown to their ancient Splendour. He likewise got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a great Body of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them with Artillery from <hi>Sedan,</hi> to be in a condition to oppose the King's Army, which only consisted of Ten thousand Foot, and Fifteen hundred Horse. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> appear'd at the Head of this last Army, and was to conduct the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Frontiers, and from thence to conduct the Queen of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he advanced towards <hi>Guienne</hi> with this Design, and the Two Armies were ready to come to a decisive Battel, the Duke <hi>de Mayenne,</hi> and the M. <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> who had the greatest Obligations to stick by the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> were gain'd over to the other Party, by some hopes that were given them of a Peace, where their own particular Interests should be so advantagiously consider'd, that they should have no more occasion to complain. For this end, an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was convened at <hi>Loudun,</hi> where those that were sent by the Court, forgot nothing that might set the Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents at variance. The Prince, who was weary of the War before he had well begun it, abandon'd the Publick Intetests, for which he pretended to have taken up Arms, and only took care of some particular Persons, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those of his own Family. He had promis'd to come to no Conclusion, till he saw the Duke of <hi>Vend me</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instated in the Castle of <hi>Nantes,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> in the Citadel of <hi>Amiens;</hi> and till the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had a Promise, That the Edicts made in their Favour should be observ'd. Nevertheless, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> being satisfied, abandon'd the rest: But they found the Party was better united than they imagin'd; so that the Treaty they made had come to nothing, if a dangerous Fit of Sickness had not seiz'd the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and so broken the Union of the Malecontents, who were now afraid of seeing themselves suddenly without a Head. The Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> endeavour'd all he could to have this Treaty sign'd by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:187699:21"/> the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour; but the Court would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it: So that at last the Peace was sign'd without it; and the Dukes of <hi>Longueville</hi> and <hi>Vendome</hi> were the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices that fell to it, as well as the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> for whom no manner of care was taken.</p>
               <p>This Peace, which ought to have produc'd a Calm at Court, caus'd nothing but Factions and Disorders there; which made the People conclude, That the Ministers had nothing less in their Consideration, than the Welfare of the Kingdom. <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Jeannin,</hi> whom Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>de Sillery</hi> had ill us'd upon certain occasions, that he alone might have the Management of all Affairs, now found means to get the Seals taken from him, and got them bestow'd upon the President <hi>du Vair.</hi> Some time after, <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Mem, d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> T. 1. p. 6.</note>

As soon as the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was recover'd, he retir'd to his Government of <hi>Berry,</hi> which was given him in the room of that of <hi>Guienne.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> went to <hi>Poitou,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to <hi>Rochel.</hi> There was only the Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who went to Court to penetrate their Designs, and to receive the Reward that was promis'd them, if they abandon'd the Party. The Mareschal, who had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Ascendant over the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by that means to get himself respected as much as he could, and to have his share in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Affairs. But <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> who had a design to model the Council anew, and admit none there, but those Persons that wholly depended upon himself, oppos'd <hi>Bouillon</hi> underhand; who plainly perceiving that there was no likelihood for him to attain his Ends by sticking to the Court, thought it would be his best way to hinder the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> from coming thither, that so he might make use of him upon occasion. The Princess of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Countess of <hi>Soissons,</hi> although they were not Friends, yet they concurr'd in the same Resolution; because they were both desirous, in case the Prince return'd, that the Court should be only oblig'd to them for it.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:187699:21"/>
               <p> But all these Intrigues came to nothing; for the Prince considering his own proper Interest, soon found it would be for his advantage to be reconcil'd to the Queen; and so manag'd this Affair by the Archbishop of <hi>Bourges.</hi> Upon condition they would employ him in publick Matters and declare him Chief of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Finances, he oblig'd himself to protect the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre;</hi> after which, he return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> He was there receiv'd with so much Joy and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that some of his Enemies endeavour'd to render him suspected to the King for it. The Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> very well saw, that the Prince now began to be govern'd by his Advice no longer; however, lest he should lose the remainder of his Credit with him, he dissembled his Disgust; and in order to form a new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, he labour'd to reconcile the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to his Brothers, and the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> to those of his Party.</p>
               <p>During these Disorders, the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> left no stone unturn'd, to get himself into some Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: He daily made his Court to the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> and contracted a Friendship with one <hi>Barbin,</hi> who was in his favour, and afterwards was made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptroller-General of the Finances: These two procur▪d for him the Place of Grand Almoner to the Queen, <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi> After he had taken possession of it, and had exercis'd it for some time, the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> gave him leave to put it again into the hands of M. <hi>Zamet,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Langres,</hi> of whom he had a considerable Summ of Money, with which he paid some Debts of his Family, and put himself in a Condition to live with greater Splendour at Court.</p>

                  </gap>g thus discharg'd from the Attendance to which this Place oblig'd him, he endeavour'd more than ever to settle himself in the Good Graces of the Mareschal, who was so great a Favourite of the Queen-Mother; and as he appear'd to him to be a Man of great Sagacity, he soon gain'd his Friendship and Confidence; so that the Mareschal began to consult him upon the most important Affairs, and gave him hopes to expect a considerable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one day from him. The Queen made him a Privy-Counsellor, and design'd him shortly after to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> in Quality of Ambassadour. He receiv'd this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:187699:22"/> Proposal with a great deal of Joy, whether it were that he was glad of an Opportunity to examine the Strength of <hi>Spain</hi> at a nearer View, or because he foresaw the Alterations that would soon happen at Court. But the Queen at last chang'd her Mind, and the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> still continu'd near her Person.</p>
               <p>As 'tis natural for us to hate Strangers, when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1616"/> to too high a degree of Fortune, but especially when they govern the State, in exclusion of the Natives, the M. <hi>d' Ancre</hi> was so universally hated, that a Man without the Spirit of Prophecy might predict that he would not enjoy his Power long. The M. <hi>de Bouillon</hi> endeavour'd to make the King jealous of him, by the means of <hi>Luines,</hi> who, by his assiduity, and the care he took to follow the King in all his Sports, now began to be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to him. The Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> an open Enemy of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> because he had hinder'd him from being restor'd to the Citadel of <hi>Amiens</hi> by the Peace of <hi>Loudun,</hi> surpriz'd the City of <hi>Pernone</hi> by private Intelligence; and 'twas fear'd he would soon make himself Master of all <hi>Picardy,</hi> a Province of the last Consequence, by reason of its Neighbourhood to <hi>Paris</hi> on one side, and to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other. The King being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to enter into some sort of Accommodation with the Duke, rather than come to Blows, sent <hi>Bouillon</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate with him, who made two Journies into <hi>Picardy,</hi> with Orders to content him; but acted quite contrary, and employ'd all his Power to engage him in the Design to ruin <hi>Concino.</hi> At the same time, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> sent the Archbishop of <hi>Bourges</hi> to this Minister, to revoke the Promise he had made him to protect him against all his Enemies; and to let him know, that he could not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Duke of <hi>Longueville.</hi> The Mareschal, who ought in Prudence, upon this News, to have retir'd to some Place of Security, with what he had gain'd in the Service of the Queen-Mother, resolv'd to stand it out, and try all means to support himself. He went to wait upon this Princess, and tells her, That the Prince mock'd her; that <hi>Bouillon</hi> deceiv'd her; and, that the rest of that Party were daily contriving how to ruin her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: To obviate and prevent which Designs, there was no other remedy than to be before-hand with them, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:187699:22"/> secure their Persons; because when this Faction was once destitute of Heads to encourage them, it would not be in a capacity to attempt any great matters. The Queen thought this Advice was somewhat too bold for her to put in execution; but the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> and <hi>Barbin</hi> so strongly represented to her the necessity of doing it, that she gave her Consent. Thus to preserve an Authority, which at the bottom could not last long, and to secure her Favourite, the Queen-Mother hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all; as, on the other side, nothing was left unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to gain the same Authority; and all this under the specious Pretence of the Publick Good; a Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which usually happens under all Regences, and under Princes that don't govern by themselves, but depend too much upon their Ministers.</p>
               <p>The Queen cast her eyes upon the Marquiss <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> to put this Project in execution; who having arrest<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the Prince in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> conducted him to the Forest of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and receiv'd, as a Reward for so bold an Action, a Mareschal's Staff of <hi>France.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> having by some means or other notice of this Design, escap'd from those that were sent to apprehend them; and the Dukes of <hi>Vendome</hi> and <hi>Guise</hi> did the same. As soon as the News of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s being imprison'd was spread in <hi>Paris,</hi> the People, instigated by his Mother, got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and their Fury went so high in the <hi>Fauxburgs</hi> of St. <hi>Germans,</hi> that the Rabble ran to the Mareschal <hi>d'Ancre</hi>'s House, and plunder'd it. The Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent took no notice of this at first, for fear of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Populace too much; but soon after, the Marquiss <hi>de Crequi Maistre de Camp</hi> of the King's Guards, put an end to this Tumult. The Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> who had retired to <hi>Sedan,</hi> was continually pressing the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to go and set the Prince at liberty, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Destruction of the Regent's Favourite. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to make him the Head of the whole Party, and counsell'd him to take up Arms without delay, and burn all the Mills about <hi>Paris,</hi> which would incense the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants the more against <hi>Concino,</hi> who was not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by them. But seeing that this Advice made no impression upon the Duke, who was thinking how to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:187699:23"/> reconcile himself to the Court, that so he might have the Command of the King's Army bestow'd upon him, he propos'd to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> to seize him. Though this Proposal was extreamly well-tim'd, and nothing could have done the Party greater Service; yet the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> would not listen to it. But the Queen did not fail to make her Advantage of this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, by gaining the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to her Side, and all those that had a dependance upon him.</p>
               <p>At this time the Queen made great Alterations in the Ministry, giving the Seals to <hi>Mangot,</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">

This was in effect but a sorry Recompence for a Service of Fifty Years, to force any other Partner upon him than <hi>Peter Bralard Sieur de Puisieux,</hi> for whom he had got a Grant of the Survivor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Nor was this the only thing that troubled <hi>Villeroy;</hi> for <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mem. d' Aub.</hi> T. 1. p. 7.</note> the King at the same time granted to the Bishop, by another Patent, the Precedence before all the other Secretaries of State; which must needs be an excessive Mortification to a Man already grown old in that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. But the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi>'s Ambition, as it knew no bounds, so it never car'd what Sacrifices fell to make the way clear for it. Soon after, the Queen publish'd an Edict, authoriz'd by the Parliament, wherein the King declares all those that had withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to be guilty of High-Treason. At the same time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1617"/> she gave the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> the Command of the Army, who made himself easily Master of all those Places which the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> had taken; and had certainly ruin'd the Affairs of the Malecontents, if the Death of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> had not in some measure re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd them.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:187699:23"/> defend himself, however the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> being in a better Posture to act than he was, oblig'd him to quit the Field. 'Tis said, that he sent a Justification in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was put into the Hands of the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> as being chief Secretary of State, but that the Bishop suppress'd it. Whether this be true or no, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Court return'd him no Answer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> who have been always accustom'd to be govern'd by their own Kings, or at least by those of their own Nation, were inrag'd to the highest degree, to see a Foreigner sit at the Head of the King's Counsel. Thus not only those that resided at Court combin'd against him, but even those that had been turn'd out of it, and were continually telling the King strange Stories of him, who was then not above Fifteen Years old. At last <hi>Luines</hi> persuaded him that this Minister thought of nothing else but how to preserve himself always in that usurp'd Station, to the great prejudice of his Majesty's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that the Queen-Mother, who was desirous to continue her Regence as long as she might, concerted Matters with him; so that the best Advice he could give him upon this occasion, was to rid his Hands of him with all speed, before he was too powerful for him. <hi>Luines</hi> knew so well how to influence the young King, by causing the same things to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually buzz'd into his Ears by others, that unexperienc'd as he was, he soon discover'd their meaning, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly dissembled this Resolution that was taken to kill the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre. Vitri,</hi> Captain of the Guards, was chosen to put it in execution; who being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by some others, kill'd him upon the Bridge of the <hi>Louvre.</hi> 'Tis <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mem. de Bassompierre,</hi> T. 1. p. 420.</note> confidently reported that he had some omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Presages of this Misfortune, and that he had propos'd to his Wife to withdraw into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Effects, which amounted to above Two Millions of Gold; but that she who was wholly abandon'd to Avarice and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oblig'd him to continue at Court. One time as he was freely opening his Mind to one of his Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Matter, he express'd a great Concern, that he was not able to overcome the Opiniatreté of his Lady, to whom he ow'd his Fortune, and therefore durst never abandon her. In short, he manag'd himself in this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:187699:24"/> Juncture, just as all those Persons do that have Sense e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to see what they ought to do, but are turn'd away from it by some unaccountable Passion, and can only accuse themselves for their own Destruction, since they do what they inwardly disapprove, and neglect to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue those Methods which they know will be of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est advantage to them. The Blow being thus given, the King turn'd all his Creatures out of their Places, which he had given them; and the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> was one of those that seem'd particularly to be mark'd out for a Sacrifice: He was forbidden to stir out of his House all that Day, and <hi>Villeroy</hi> retook his place of Secretary of State, thinking he should now discharge this Office without dividing it with the Bishop. The other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ministers and Counsellors of State did likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume their Posts. The Queen saw her self at the same time deprived of her own Guards, and surrounded by those belonging to the King, without being able to speak a Word to any one. She was afterwards condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Castle of <hi>Blois;</hi> where they kept her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd under a strict Guard. The Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> presented himself to the King, to justifie his own Conduct; and <hi>Luines</hi> gave this Testimony of him, That he had faithfully serv'd his Majesty. The King immediately order'd him to continue to serve him in his Council; but the Bishop finding some difficulty to get admission there from some of the ancient Ministers who were lately re-established, his Majesty commanded <hi>Vignoles</hi> to accompany him to the Council-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Vignoles</hi> gave them to understand that the King had order'd the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> to serve him as before. <hi>Villeroy</hi> who had never been at the Council-Table since the Death of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> thought they design'd to make him his Partner, so he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <hi>Vignoles</hi> to go and enquire of the King, whether it was in that Quality that the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted into the Council. In the mean time, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop being sensible that now the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> was gone, he had no more to do there, was resolved to give himself the Honour of this Affair: So calling the President <hi>Jeannin</hi> to him, he requested him to acquaint <hi>Villeroy,</hi> that he had not the least Pretensions to his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:187699:24"/> Place. Soon after <hi>Vignoles</hi> return'd, and told them his Majesty's meaning was, that the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> should only serve him in Quality of Privy-Counsellor. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the Bishop withdrew, and the Secretaries of State representing to the King what an Injury they might hereafter sustain by that Order, which enabled the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> to take place of them all, since other Bishops when they were admitted into the Council might draw a President from it, his Majesty was pleased to revoke it. There is this <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Memoirs d' Aubery,</hi> p. 8. T. 1.</note> remarkable Passage in this Revocation, That <hi>under a pretence of the Episcopal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the Bishop of</hi> Luçon, <hi>who at that time was one of the Secretaries of State, had the Precedence given him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the other Secretaries, in all Meetings of the Council and publick Assemblies, to the manifest preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Order which is observ'd among them, and indeed of all Equity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this had pass'd, it was not much for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Luçon</hi>'s Credit to tarry at Court; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no one in these Circumstances but would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately withdrawn; nay, perhaps any one but he would have return'd to his Bishoprick, to discharge those weighty Functions to which his Character oblig'd him. But as for him, who only consider'd the Episcopal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as a fairer step to advance himself in the World, he went by the King's Permission to wait upon the Queen at <hi>Blois,</hi> in hopes of being re-establish'd in his Fortune as soon as she was. He pretended to take upon him the care of her Domestick Affairs, and assum'd the Title of Steward of her Houshold, without troubling his Head whether it was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Profession of a Bishop. But <hi>Luines,</hi> who was apprehensive of the busie active Genius of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, least he should suggest some Advices to the Queen, whereby she might reconcile her self to the King, sent him Word Three or Four Weeks after, That it was his Majesty's Pleasure he should immediately retire to his Priory of <hi>Coussay</hi> in <hi>Anjou.</hi> After he had shut himself up in this place, People suspected, that instead of medling with Theological Tracts, as he pretended, he was writing Memoirs and Dispatches concerning Affairs of State. From hence he writ a Letter of Justification to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:187699:25"/> the King <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Aube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Hist. of Card. <hi>Rich.</hi> p. 14.</note>, wherein he acquaints him, <q>That some of those Persons who design'd to destroy his Credit with the Queen, had endeavour'd to insinuate into her Majesty, that she ought not to repose any Confidence in him, because he was too zealous for the Service of the King, and of those whom he most affected:</q>
                  <hi>(This was assuredly a most horrid Calumny; for our good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop minded nothing but his own Advancement:)</hi>
                  <q>That nevertheless the Queen, who had no other Intentions than to live peaceably in an entire Obedience to her Son, express'd the greater Kindness to him for it, and confided the more in his Advice: That by the like Artifices of the same Persons, divers Reports were spread abroad, That the King was not well pleas'd to see him near the Queen his Mother; That upon this he had beg'd her Permission to retire for some time, and inform himself more particularly of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Pleasure: That he had lived privately ever since at his own House, searching among his Books, an Employment not unsuitable to his Profession: That nevertheless the Queen had signified to him the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction she took to hear that it was the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that he should in a short time return to her again: Lastly, That he prayed to God to shew him no mercy, if ever in Thought or Deed he had acted contrary to his Majesty's Service.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ambiguous Oath, which will admit of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1618"/> meaning a Man is pleas'd to give it, wrought no wonderful Effects at Court: On the contrary, they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected more than ever, that he endeavour'd to get himself restor'd by the Queen's means, who could not always continue in Disgrace. To remove him the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Blois,</hi> he was order'd to go and reside at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon;</hi> nay, thinking he was still too near her, they commanded him to depart the Kingdom, and expect the King's Orders at <hi>Avignon.</hi> During his Abode in this place, he compos'd or finish'd Two Books, one of which is entituled, <hi>The Instruction of a Christian,</hi> and contains the Principles of Christianity, according to the Order of the Apostles Creed, the Decalogue, the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other is a Controversial Treatise, with this Title, <hi>A Defence of the Principal Points of our Belief, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:187699:25"/>
                  <hi>a Letter of Four Ministers of</hi> Charenton, <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King.</hi> There is nothing in both these Works, but is what extreamly mean and indifferent; so that if they cost the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> any great pains, all the World must own, that he was an abler Politician than a Divine.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Luines</hi> was absolute Master of the King's Inclinations, whom he amus'd with childish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes, or with Exercises of Devotion, to which this Prince had naturally a great Propensity. He would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none to approach or talk with him in private, unless he knew what the matter was; and although he had few or no Friends in the Kingdom to support him; and besides, had but a very small insight into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, yet he adventured to sit at the Helm, and after he had inrich'd himself with the Spoils of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> who in a Ministry of seven Years had heap'd together a prodigious Wealth, he saw himself in a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation to be respected by the greatest Persons in the Kingdom. As the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had now for a long while been imprison'd in the Castle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and the Queen confin'd at <hi>Blois,</hi> it was high time to consider to set one of them at Liberty, because it was not possible to find a pretence for keeping both in Custody. Several Reasons hinder'd him from determining himself in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Prince, who was equally covetous, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and to acquire Riches. The <hi>French</hi> naturally have as great an Affection for the Princes of the Blood, as they have an Aversion to the Ministers; so that to take the Prince out of his Prison, was in effect the same thing, as to re-establish him in the Government of the State. As he was exceedingly belov'd by the People, and of a bold daring Temper, it was not to be suppos'd that he would accept of <hi>Luines</hi> as his Equal in the Administration of Affairs, who could not endure to see the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> in that Post: Nay, though he should not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himself in publick Matters, yet he lov'd Money so excessively, that he would either have the possession or disposal of all Offices, when they were vacant. It seem'd that <hi>Luines</hi> had not so much to apprehend from the Queen-Mother, who was at that time depriv'd of her most faithful Servants, and in whom the King in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:187699:26"/> would never repose any great Confidence, after he had treated her in so course a manner. But then she was so strongly incensed against <hi>Luines,</hi> who was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of her Disgrace, that if ever she had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to express her Revenge, there was no question to be made but she would do it effectually.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Luines</hi> was thus perplex'd what Side to take in this difficult Conjuncture, the Queen-Mother depriv'd him of the means to declare himself in favour of her. The Mareschal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> had advised her to endeavour to make her escape out of the Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> and to sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to assist her upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He was a Person of great Authority, Courage, and Sagacity; and one that had perform'd great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for <hi>Henry</hi> IV. The difficulty was how to gain him, because he was then at Court, with a design to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite himself to the Royal Party. To accomplish this, the Queen's secret Friends employ'd all their Cunning to render the Duke suspected to <hi>Luines</hi> for his great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and his proud and haughty Temper, Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were enough to give umbrage to a Minister. On the other hand, they endeavour'd to provoke the Duke against <hi>Luines,</hi> representing to him, that if he did not daily make his Court to him, he must never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to obtain any thing at his hands. It was a long while ago since they had promised to get a Cardinal's Cap for his Son the Archbishop of <hi>Toulouse,</hi> without giving themselves any trouble to make good their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; and to inflame him the more, <hi>Du Vair,</hi> Keeper of the Seals, having had some Contests with the Duke about their taking of Places at the Council-Table, the Keeper of the Seals had obtain'd a Decree in favour of himself. This disgusted the Duke exceedingly, who was also possess'd with an Imagination, that there was a design to apprehend him; so that he resolved, without taking any Farewel, to retire to <hi>Metz,</hi> of which Place he was Governour, and performed it without any difficulty. <hi>Vincennes,</hi> who had been Secretary to the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi>

He was to assign her <hi>Loches</hi> for her retirement, or any other place in his Government of <hi>Saintonges;</hi> but what was to have been executed in the Summer of the Year 1618, was not done till the beginning of the next Year, by reason of some Disappointments, which we shall here omit,</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> having travers'd all <hi>France</hi> with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1619"/> Three Hundred Horse, arriv'd at <hi>Loches</hi> in the Month of <hi>January;</hi> and one Night the Queen got out of the Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> through a Window, by the assistance of a certain Ladder, which an <hi>Exempt</hi> of the Guards had provided for her, at the foot of which were Four or Five Persons to receive her, with <hi>du Plessis,</hi> a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi> The Queen walk'd with them along the Ditch, and got to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Bridge, where her Coach waited for her: She had none but one of the Women of the Bed-Chamber with her, and carried away nothing but her Jewels, and a Lanthorn; for she durst not be all Night in the Coach without a Wax-Candle lighted. After this manner she was conducted to <hi>Montrichard,</hi> where she changed Horses, and found the Abbot <hi>Rucellai,</hi> with the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toulouse,</hi> and some other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons waited for her. With this Company she went to <hi>Loches,</hi> and made all the haste she cou'd. The Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who had arriv'd there the Evening before, came a League out of Town to meet her; but the Queen after she had staid a day there to expect her Train, retir'd to <hi>Angoulême,</hi> where several that were disgusted at <hi>Luines</hi>'s Ministry, came to offer their Service to her. 'Tis affirm'd, that this Enterprize which had been a long while projecting, was communicated to abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People, but that <hi>Luines</hi> was so negligent, that he had not the least notice of it; which evidently shows that this Minister was not so well qualified for the Post he held.</p>
               <p>He was in a strange confusion when this News first arriv'd to him, and that the Queen ow'd her Liberty to others, by which he might have oblig'd her himself, if, as it was in his Power, he had procur'd it for her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:187699:27"/> before. But it happily fell out for him that the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> who was weary of writing Theological Books in his Exile, sent his Brother-in-Law <hi>du Pont de Courlay</hi> to offer his Service to him, and to assure him that his greatest Ambition was to serve the King, and himself in particular. <hi>Luines</hi> accepted his Offer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he was the fittest Person to bring the Queen to an Accommodation, and to sow Dissention between those of her Party; so to lose no time, he sent him a Pass-port from the King, with a Letter, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd him to make all the hast imaginable to go to the Queen-Mother. At the bottom of the Letter the King added these Words with his own Hand, <hi>I desire you to believe that what is written above is my Will, and that you cannot do me a greater Service than to see it perform'd.</hi> The Bishop departed as soon as ever he receiv'd this Letter, and taking Post, was stopt between <hi>Valence</hi> and <hi>Vienne,</hi> by the Captain of the Guards to the Marquis <hi>d▪Alencourt,</hi> Governour of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and conducted to that City; but upon showing his Orders from the King and <hi>Luines,</hi> he made his Excuse, and suffer'd him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Journey. Being at last arriv'd at <hi>Angolême,</hi> after he had receiv'd necessary Instructions from <hi>Luines,</hi> he knew so well how to conceal the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence which he entertain'd with this Minister, that he perswaded her it was only his desire to serve her which had made him travel thro' the Kindom with so much danger to himself, to be near her Person. This Discourse made so sensible an Impression upon this Princess, that she look'd upon him to be the most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant she had about her. In a few Days he so wrought upon her by his Insinuations, that the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence she repos'd in the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toulouse,</hi> was exceedingly diminish'd. He prevail'd so far as to have the Abbot <hi>Ruccellai</hi> turn'd away and made her jealous of the Marquis <hi>de Themines,</hi> and <hi>de Mosny;</hi> so that he was the only Person to whom the Queen discover'd her most important Affairs, and whose Advice she rely'd upon. Thus he preserv'd at the same time the Favour of the Court, and that of the Queen, to put himself in a Capacity to make the best Advantage of an Accommodation, whatever it was▪
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:187699:27"/> Soon after a Treaty was concluded at <hi>Angolême,</hi> by which some places of Security were put into the Queen's hands, that so she might have no scruple to come back to Court. One of these places was the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of <hi>Angers,</hi> the Goverment of which the Queen bestow'd upon <hi>Richlieu,</hi> eldest Brother to the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> and after his Death to the <hi>Commandeur de la Porte,</hi> his Unkle by the Mother's side. The Bishop plac'd such Governours as he saw fitting at <hi>Pont du Cé,</hi> and at <hi>Chinon:</hi> However finding no prospect as yet to get himself re-admitted into the Council of State, in case he came along with the Queen to Court, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded this Princess from going thither, tho' the King incessantly press'd her to come. At this time the King was at <hi>Tours,</hi> and was in hopes that his Mother wou'd soon visit him there; but all that she promised him amounted only to this, that she would go to <hi>Angers,</hi> where she should be nearer to his Majesty. This Prince soon after writ her a very affectionate Letter, which was brought to her by the Duke <hi>de Montba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Father-in-Law to <hi>Luines,</hi> wherein he assur'd her how desirous he was to live with her, as he had formerly done. But it was impossible to alter her Resolution; so that the Court began to suspect there was some Artifice in the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi>'s Conduct, and that he had a mind to render himself more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the King, by retarding this Accommodation which they so passionately desir'd.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Montbason</hi> at his <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> return from <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lême,</hi> inform'd the King that the Queen Mother stuck at some Difficulties of small importance, as among the rest, that pursuant to the Promise which the King had made her, to restore the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and all the rest that had follow'd her, to their former Offices; she requir'd that two Captains of the King's Guards that had attended her, should be likewise re-establish'd. But tho' the King had made this Promise in general terms, he did not judge it convenient to trust his Person in the hands of those People that had carried Arms against him. The Queen likewise made a difficulty to come directly to meet the King, and complain'd that he did not invite her to come and see him, but forc'd her.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:187699:28"/> She said she would go to <hi>Angers,</hi> and that after she had taken possession of that place, she wou'd come to Court. These studied Objections on the Queen's side seem'd to argue not only a great Distrust, but a much greater Artifice <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Vit. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri Memor. Rec.</hi> p. 42. T. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note>; so that it was no longer to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> was the occasion of all this. In fine, the Queen's obstinacy carry'd it, and <hi>Tormigeres</hi> and <hi>Borde</hi> were restor'd to their Regiment of the Guards; altho' when the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> retir'd to <hi>Metz,</hi> they follow'd him without leave, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of their Soldiers. The King express'd a great unwillingness to consent to this re-establishment, but <hi>Luines</hi> at last prevail'd with him to grant it, to let the Queen-Mother see he was ready to serve her in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lay in his power, and to support himself on this side against the Authority of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was still in Prison, and had just occasion to complain that he was kept there so long. For the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Queen was left at liberty, to come directly to <hi>Tours,</hi> or else to go to <hi>Angers</hi> before, that so she might not harbour any suspicion that there was a design to lead her in Triumph to <hi>Paris,</hi> as she had pretended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. When they now expected that she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready on her Journey, she demanded to have the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> put into her hands, for her Security that she should receive no ill Treatment; but as he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to serve for an Hostage, and besides, being a Subject of the King, if they had not thought fit to keep their Word, they wou'd have made no account of that pretended Security, therefore the Queen was given to understand that it was to no purpose to demand it; so that at last she contented herself with Letters from the King, from <hi>Luines,</hi> and Father <hi>Arnaud</hi> his Majesty's Confessor.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>August</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 24.</note> the King made two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschals of <hi>France, Pralin,</hi> and <hi>S. Geran,</hi> whom <hi>Luines</hi> by this favour brought over to his own Party, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they had no Kindness for him before. At the same time a Patent pass'd the Seals for him, by which the King declar'd him Duke and Peer of <hi>France,</hi> as soon as he purchas'd some Lands, which wou'd enable him to carry that Title. One of his Brothers resign'd the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:187699:28"/> Earldom of <hi>Maillé</hi> to him, and so by joining some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states in the Neighbourhood to it, he caus'd them to be erected into a Dutchy and Peerdom. There was some difficulty to get his Letters registred in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris,</hi> because the Mareschal <hi>de l'Esdigueres,</hi> who had the like Patent some time before, had it not as yet registred, and it was not reasonable that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother should pass before his. This he got his Son-in-Law the Marquis <hi>de Crequi</hi> to represent at Court, but the fortune of <hi>Luines</hi> carried it.</p>
               <p>At last the Queen <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 29.</note> parted from <hi>Angoulême,</hi> with a Train of Ten Coaches and Six Horses, and Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Persons on Horse-back. When she took her leave of the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> she made him a Present of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Diamond, not to repay the Expence he had been at; for he had spent Two Hundred Thousand Crowns in her Service, but to keep it in Memory of her. As for himself, he accompanied her no farther than the Frontiers of his Province; but his Son the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toulouse</hi> staid with her still. Several other Persons of Quality accompanied her likewise, and among the rest the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> for whose Services she had too much occasion to send him back to his Diocess. She dispatch'd him to go before to inform his Majesty of her arrival, and he was receiv'd at Court with all Demonstrations of Kindness, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> who was ravish'd to see the Accommodation with the Queen - Mother at last concluded. Next Morning the Bishop return'd to certifie the Queen after what manner they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd this News at Court.</p>
               <p>As she <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 4.</note> drew near, the Cardinal of <hi>Rets,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arnaud</hi> came to meet her; nay, the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> advanc'd as far as <hi>Montbason,</hi> where he saluted her with all the Marks of an entire submission, and where he was likewise receiv'd with a great deal of Civility. The Queen conducted him herself to her Closet, where she tarried two Hours alone with him. 'Tis commonly reported that he excus'd himself for all that was past, and made solemn Protestations to serve her for the future; so that the Queen appear'd to be very well satisfied. The next Day the King came in Person to <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieres,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:187699:29"/> a House belonging to the Duke of <hi>Montbason,</hi> near <hi>Tours,</hi> where the Queen being first arriv'd, she went to receive him on foot in the Park. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son embrac'd one another with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signs of Tenderness, and every thing that had pass'd seem'd to be entirely forgotten. The Queen was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd all she demanded, but especially a Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for which she pretended to have present occasion. The King receiv'd those whom she presented to him, as the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toulouse,</hi> and several others that had serv'd her, with extraordinary Kindness. At last the whole Court took the way to <hi>Tours,</hi> and the King having parted first on Horse-back, the Queen follow'd him in her Coach. From <hi>Tours</hi> the Court went to <hi>Maillé,</hi> which the King with great Solemnity erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Dutchy and Peerdom, in honour of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, who gave a most magnificent Entertainment there.</p>
               <p>After the King had thus seen his Mother the second time, they liv'd to all appearance in perfect Amity; nor was the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> backward to pay her all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Respects; so that she seem'd to be disgusted at nothing. Nevertheless, as they fail'd to perform what they had promis'd her, when they talk'd of going to <hi>Paris,</hi> she began to say she was not in a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to be carried in Triumph thither; so that she par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>Angers,</hi> on <hi>September</hi> the 23d. after she had given her Promise to follow the King soon after. All People were surpriz'd, that after she had obtain'd whatever she desir'd, and had concluded so advantagious a Treaty, she made any scruple to go to <hi>Paris:</hi> But besides that the Treaty was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> faithfully executed, she found she should have no share in the Government, any farther than the King would be pleas'd to allow her, whereas she Reign'd absolutely before; this made her imagine, that if she went with the King to <hi>Paris,</hi> it would be all one as if she follow'd his Triumphant Chariot. 'Tis indeed very probable, that the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> who accompanied her evety-where, took care so to put this <hi>Idea</hi> into her Head; who was resolv'd neither to go to his Bishoprick, nor return to <hi>Paris,</hi> with the bare Title of Bishop of <hi>Luçon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:187699:29"/>
               <p> Before the Queen-Mother parted for <hi>Angers,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> had endeavour'd to sound her Inclinations, about setting the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> at liberty: But she could not be brought to declare her Mind upon that Article. However, as the Duke was sensible that he could confine him no longer, without raising too great a number of Malecontents; and that it was commonly said, That the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were preparing to demand his Liberty, he thought it would be a piece of good Policy to secure himself of the Prince's Friendship, by preventing them. Although the Queen-Mother had protested she was very well satisfied with him, yet he thought it not prudent to rely too much upon it; and the Authority of the Prince seem'd to him very proper to counterballance the Power of that Princess. With these Resolutions he arriv'd at <hi>Vincennes</hi> the 19th. of <hi>October,</hi> and presented to the Prince a Letter from the King, whereby he set him at liberty, after he had been a Prisoner three Years and two Months. He offered him his Service, and conjured him to take him into his Protection; which the Prince promised to do with abundance of Joy. The next day the Prince came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and begg'd the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on his Knees, beseeching him to forgive what was past, and thanking him for the Liberty he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him. The King made him rise up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Compliment, and received him very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Queen-Mother spoke not the least word of coming back to Court, and gave them fresh occasion to suspect her, by receiving a Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the <hi>Hugonots</hi> assembled at <hi>Loudun</hi> had made her. They testified the great Joy they received at her coming, and at her abode in the Province of <hi>Anjou;</hi> and communicated to her the Demands they design'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the King. The Queen graciously thanked them, and assured them they should have a good Neighbour of her. It was the Opinion at Court, that she ought to have sent back that Deputation to the King, to prevent all suspicion of any new Quarrels. They were also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased that she drew after her the Nobility of <hi>Anjou</hi> and the neighbouring Places, who made her frequenter Visits than the Court desired. The Duke of <hi>Luines</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:187699:30"/> never <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vit. Siri</hi> T. 5. <hi>des Mem. Rec.</hi> p. 62.</note> mentioned her but with a world of Respect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, on the other side, he did all that lay in his power to oblige the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whom he got re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his Government of <hi>Berry,</hi> and to his Pensions. He gained him admission into the Cabinet-Council, and seemed to pay a wonderful Deference to all his Opinions. Now the Prince and he were both agreed, that the sooner they prevailed with the Queen to come to Court, it would be so much the better, and hinder her from always fomenting a Party in the State. But the more they press'd her to come back, the more Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences she found to defer her Journey.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> in this interval <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 14.</note>, took the usual Oath in Parlaiment, in Quality of Duke and Peer: The Marquis <hi>de Crequi</hi> came thither after him, to get the Patent of his Father-in-Law the Mareschal <hi>de l'Esdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueres,</hi> registred likewise, who was received after the same manner, and between whom and the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> it was agreed, that the latter should give him the Precedence during his Life only. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to do the greater Honour to the Favourite, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to the Parliament, and brought him back. At the same time a Declaration of the King was printed and published, bearing Date the 9th. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> concerning the Enlargement of the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> in the Preamble of which, it was said, That the past Disorders had sufficiently convinced the World to what a heighth the Boldness of some Persons was arrived, who because they had the Honour to be related to the King, and to have some Offices in the State, had so notoriously abused his Name and Authority, that if God Almighty had not given him Resolution and Courage enough to chastise them, the whole Kingdom had fallen into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Confusion. Among the other Mischiefs which their ill Conduct had occasioned, the Prince's Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was reckoned as one, whom 'twas said they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to destory, as well as <hi>France.</hi> The King declared him wholly innocent, and gave him this Testimony, that he had done nothing but what was for the Grandeur of his Soveraign, and the good of the State. All this was directly contrary to what had hitherto been done, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Prince, and particularly to his Confinement,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:187699:30"/> which the King had approved of long ago. At the bottom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1615"/> it was true, that neither the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> nor the Prince, had any regard to the Welfare of the State, or the King's Glory, but only to enrich themselves, and support their own Authority: But then the Fault was infinitely more pardonable in the First Prince of the Blood, than in a <hi>Florentine,</hi> as <hi>Concino Concini</hi> was; so that when once Resolutions were taken to re-establish the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> it was the best way to throw all the Accusation upon the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> whom they had ordered to be slain.</p>
               <p>This Declaration being communicated to the Queen, extreamly offended her for the manner wherein it was worded, because it openly reflected upon her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency; although the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> sent a Gentleman to compliment her, the very Morning he was set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> who had advised her to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Prince, could not read the beginning of the King's Declaration, without seeing himself condemned by it, and what he was to expect from a Man of that Quality, in whose Favour the King expressed himself in such emphatical Terms. However, he dissembled the matter, and laboured to fix himself in the good Graces of the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> though he still waited upon the Queen, who reposed Confidence in him. She refused to return to Court, unless they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her the same Number of Guards she used to have during her Regency. This at first occasioned abundance of Difficulties; but in the conclusion, <hi>Luines,</hi> who was apprehensive that the Prince's Interest would enerease too fast, prevailed to have it granted her.</p>
               <p>It was now believed that nothing more remain'd to bring the Queen to Court, and that she would set <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1620"/> forward as soon as her Affairs would permit her, when the Negotiation began to slacken on the sudden, through the Intrigues of those that were about her, who desired to see her as great in the Government as formerly she had been, without which her return to Court would be of no Service to them, since she would not be in a capacity to reward them. But to propose so nice and ticklish a Point as this, was enough to break off all again. The Queen suspected the new Friendship between the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:187699:31"/> Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Luines;</hi> and as the latter was afraid of this Princess, he made a greater Interest every Day in the Prince. In the mean time the Duke and his Two Brothers had an absolute Sway at Court, and manag'd all things as they pleas'd, sticking at nothing that might do them any Advantage, and no Injury.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother, who had seem'd to acquiesce in the Reasons which were sent to her, concerning the King's Declaration in favour of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> began to raise new Complaints about it. She would have the King publish another to justifie her Conduct, since she had not imprison'd the Prince without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majesty before-hand without it. She gave out that she would receive the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> into Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, altho' he was a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> and hated by the Prince, because he was in the same Room with him in the <hi>Louvre</hi> when he was apprehended, and did not make the least offer to rescue him. This was sufficient to raise new Contests, which were not so easie to be determin'd. The King was too much vex'd that he had publish'd Two opposite Declarations, the one against, and the other for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to be ever perswaded to issue out a third: However they were afraid that the Queen would bring over the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to her Party. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate these Differences, and bury these Suspicions, the King offer'd to write his Mother a Letter, which should be the same in effect with a Declaration; and the Queen offer'd to certifie the Publick in Writing, that she had made no secret Confederacy with the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> She likewise offer'd to make the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> leave <hi>Angers.</hi> But the Reasons of the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> and those that had serv'd her, continu'd still in the same force; so that these and several other Proposals had no manner of Success, but came to nothing.</p>
               <p>While this Treaty was on Foot, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who was disgusted because the King had not paid him the Hundred and fifty thousand Crowns which had been promis'd him long ago, to defray the Expences he had been at, left the Court without taking leave of the King, and posted down by great Journeys to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <note place="margin">* The 28th of <hi>March.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Guienne.</hi> His unexpected Departure whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:187699:31"/> confirm'd the Court in their Suspicions, that a great Party of Malecontents was already form'd, and that the Queen-Mother would appear at the Head of them. The greatest Lords in the Kingdom seem'd to be of that side; and after the Death of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> so little Satisfaction had been given them, that the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> had reason to apprehend a Storm from every quarter. The King's Youth and Temper, which was naturally timorous and distrustful, gave him just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be upon his Guard: And as his Majesty must of necessity be the Prey of the Victorious Party, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently approve their Conduct, and condemn the weaker side, there was no regard had to the Welfare of the Nation, but every one was finding out proper means to fortifie the Faction he had espous'd.. Upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> after a long Debate, came to this Resolution at last, to use all his Endeavours to bring the Queen to Court again. He design'd to send the Duke of <hi>Montbason</hi> to her; who at first refus'd to go thither, because, he said, the Queen would reproach him that nothing of what he had promis'd her by the King's Order had been perform'd, and that he had no Excuses to make for that Omission. To oblige him to undertake this Journey, and to remove all Difficulties which the Queen might raise, they gave him a Blank Paper, with a promise to ratifie, without any hesitation, whatever she desir'd. He * parted with these Orders, <note place="margin">The 6th of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </note> and the King follow'd him a few Days after and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as far as <hi>Tours,</hi> in order to press the Queen's return with greater Vigour, a Solecism in Politicks, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of People condemn'd, as being more likely to alarm than bring her home.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montbason</hi> being soon arriv'd at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> found the Queen dispos'd, in all appearance▪ to come to Court; but she was willing to see part of what was promis'd her perform'd before-hand, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what related to a certain Summ of Money, which had not been paid her, notwithstanding all the fair Words they had given her, to oblige her in this Point. She likewise said there was no necessity of the King's coming as far as <hi>Tours,</hi> and that she cou'd find the way well enough to <hi>Paris,</hi> without his giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:187699:32"/> the trouble of coming so far. After this Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, she dispatch'd <hi>Bouthillier</hi> her Secretary to Court, and the Duke of <hi>Montbason</hi> sent a Gentleman to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the King of what had past. It was thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that the King, who was already at <hi>Orleans,</hi> shou'd return back; so he <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ap.</hi> 15.</note> went to <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Paris;</hi> which confirm'd the Opinion of those Persons who had disapprov'd of his Voyage. The Duke of <hi>Montbason</hi> came back shortly after, and assur'd them there was no way so effectual to facilitate the Queen's return, as to give her satisfaction in all they had promis'd her, and particularly to remit her those Summs of Money, which they had engag'd to let her have. But the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> who could have been content with all his heart that none of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises should be observ'd, for fear of increasing the Forces of the Queen's Party, cou'd not resolve to keep his Word with her; and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd him in this Humour, by making Advice be given him from all parts, that the Queen had form'd a Design to get him Assassinated. The Queen for her part, had no great Inclinations to put herself again in the hands of the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> by coming back to Court, unless she were convinc'd by seeing the Treaty executed, that they design'd to deal honourably with her. Nevertheless as it was a Matter of the highest importance to the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> to disengage the Queen from the Party of the Male-contents, he sent her the Money she demanded, and perform'd some other things, according to her desires.</p>
               <p>The Messenger that was dispatch'd upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion found the Scene somewhat alter'd, altho' the Queen made continual Protestations that she long'd for nothing more than to see her Son. She plainly told him that she could not trust herself with the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> and much less with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> of whom she made very severe Complaints; that she cou'd not come back to the Court with any Security, unless some foreign Prince, or the Parliaments of the Kingdom wou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, to be <hi>Guarrantees</hi> of the Treaty; that if they wou'd give her none of these Securities, she shou'd be oblig'd to continue at <hi>Angers,</hi> where she wou'd expect
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:187699:32"/> the performance of the other things they had promis'd her; that if they molested her, she wou'd take all the measures she judg'd necessary to defend herself. <hi>Blain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> who was the Person that was sent to the Queen, having acquainted the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> with what she had told him; this Favourite began to fear that she sought an opportunity to embroil him with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deliver him into their hands. <hi>Blainville</hi> in endeavouring to insinuate himself into the Queen's good Affections, possess'd her with new Apprehensions. He told her the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> wou'd never give ear to several suggestions of her Majesty's Enemies, who had frequently intimated to him, that he might with more safety to himself have shut her up close in the Castle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> or sent her back to <hi>Florence,</hi> or done something worse to her. This Discourse made the Queen recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect with herself, and thinking what a Risque she had run while she was in the hands of the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> she consider'd in what new Dangers she shou'd be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd if she return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> being sent for back to Court, excus'd himself from going thither, pretending he could do his Majesty greater Service in his Government than at <hi>Paris,</hi> but promis'd at the same time to continue inviolably firm to his Interests. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless it was known that he had sent several Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to the Queen-Mother, to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Montmorenci,</hi> and that he had been at <hi>Blaye</hi> to confer with the Count <hi>d' Aubeterre,</hi> Governour of that important place, and one that was disaffected to the Court. The Countess of <hi>Soissons</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so entertain'd a strict Correspondence with the Queen, and it was fear'd that she would quit the Court, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her Son, to joyn with the Duke of <hi>Longuevil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> her Son-in-Law.</p>
               <p>This inauspicious disposition of Affairs so far influenc'd the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> that, notwithstanding all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he try'd all ways to accommodate matters with the Queen. He dispatch'd <hi>Blainville</hi> afresh to her, with a Summ of Two Hundred Thousand Franks, and granted her several other things which she demanded; but as for what regarded the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:187699:33"/> she insisted upon, it was not possible for him to oblige her in that Point. To make amends for that, the King writ to her, and assur'd her that she might safely depend upon his Word; and that if the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> did not treat her as she expected, he wou'd give her leave to depart when she pleas'd. Upon this the Queen seem'd willing enough to come to Court; but she demanded some time to prepare herself for her Journey, being not in a condition to depart immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> and her other Counsellors talk'd after the same manner; but in answer to the Kings Letter, they reply'd, that his Word was not a sufficient Security to his Mother, because as the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> had the entire disposal of his Will, so he would make him do whatever he pleas'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blainville</hi> return'd to Court with this Answer; but was soon * sent back to <hi>Angers,</hi> to acquaint the Queen <note place="margin">
                     <hi>June</hi> 19.</note> that his Majesty gave her Three Weeks to prepare for her Journey, which had been so long expected; and that in the mean time he conjur'd her not to be alarm'd at those Preparations for War he was now making.</p>
               <p>As the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> affected to govern the State alone, and to be the only Channel by which the King distributed all his Favours to his Subjects, in exclusion of the greatest Lords in the Kingdom, the farther he went, the more Enemies he created to himself. The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> made his escape out of <hi>Paris</hi> by Night, and retir'd to <hi>Angers;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Vendome</hi> did the same, and the Queen's Party increas'd every Day. The Court * receiv'd information that the Countess of <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Soissons</hi> was ready to follow them, with her Son, and the Count <hi>de St. Aignan:</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> instead of resolving suddenly what Measures to take in this Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juncture, gave them an Opportunity to escape. Thus the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being left alone at Court, there was none to counter-ballance his Authority but the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> who had no other Foundation to trust to but his Master's Favour, which might change. The King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himself to nothing; and had neither Resolution e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do any thing of his own head, nor Constancy to make himself be fear'd. He wanted an able Minister, that possess'd the Royal Qualities of which he was desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:187699:33"/> to govern in his Name. All the Grandees who knew his Weakness, pretended to this Post, and were assur'd their Conduct would be approv'd, if they cou'd by any means attain it. This caus'd all the Divisions that threw the State into such frequent Convulsions, and which lasted till a great Minister, who had an absolute Ascendant over the King's Spirit, was in a capacity to destroy all those that pretended to share the Supreme Authority with him.</p>
               <p>At this time the Queen's Party was in a formidable Posture. All the Maritime Provinces from <hi>Diepe</hi> as far as the <hi>Garonne,</hi> were in the hands of the Male-contents, with abundance of places all over the Kingdom, and a considerable number of great Lords, and experienc'd Officers. The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was Master of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi> the Count <hi>de Soissons</hi> possess'd <hi>Dreux, Ferté-Bernard, Perche,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Maine;</hi> the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>Boisdausin</hi> held all about <hi>Santre</hi> and <hi>Mayenne, Châ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, Goutier,</hi> and <hi>Sablé;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Vendome</hi> was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a great part of the course of the River <hi>Loire,</hi> upon which the Queen had <hi>Angers</hi> and <hi>Pont de Cé;</hi> the Dukes <hi>de la Trimouille,</hi> and <hi>de Rets</hi> had under them, the first <hi>Poitou,</hi> and the other <hi>Britany;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> was Governour of <hi>St. John d' Angeli;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> commanded in <hi>Angoumois,</hi> and in <hi>Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> govern'd <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Guienne.</hi> In short, several others of the best Quality in the Kingdom, who were encourag'd by the King's weakness to hope for every thing, held a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of strong Places, and were ready to make the best Advantage they could of these publick Commotions. But that which in all probability seem'd to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate this Party, proved the occasion of its Ruine: I mean, too many People were engag'd in it, and their different Views and Interests hindred them from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with the other.</p>
               <p>The King, or rather the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> strangely preplex'd in this Conjuncture, sent a solemn Deputation to the Queen, compos'd of <hi>Du Perron,</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Sens,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Montbason,</hi> and the President <hi>Jean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi> who were follow'd by Father <hi>Berulle,</hi> who was charged with Secret Instructions. But the Queen who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:187699:34"/> waited till her Party had taken secure Measures, spun out and protracted the Treaty, hoping not to come back to Court, but with the same Authority which she had enjoy'd in her Son's Minority. But it was not so easie a matter for them to agree in their Proposals, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such different Projects to any Uniformity, tho' all of them seem'd to centre in the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, and consequently the re-establishment of the Queen. In this Exigence the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> gave the King very seasonable Advice, which was to take the Field as soon as was possible, to attack the principal Male-contents before the rest cou'd come up to relieve them. He declar'd that if this Conduct had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd in the Tumults wherein he was concern'd, he had not been in a Capacity to oppose the Court, whose irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution gave him time to fortify himself. It was therefore resolv'd to march the Troops of <hi>Champagne</hi> on the side of <hi>Chartres,</hi> under the command of <hi>Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre;</hi> whilst the King went in Person into <hi>Normandy,</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Longueville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before his departure, the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> judg'd it expedient for the King to <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 4.</note> go to the Parliament, to justifie his Conduct to them. He declared to them how much it troubled him to see himself constrain'd to act against the Queen his Mother, altho' he desir'd nothing more earnestly than to live with her like an obedient and respectful Son. He added, that since she had put herself at the head of these Male-contents, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig▪d to take up Arms to dissipate that Party, and that being inform'd that <hi>Roan</hi> was in danger, he resolv'd to march that way. He concluded with recommending the repose of the City of <hi>Paris</hi> to their Care, and told them he entirely depended upon their Fidelity and Diligence. The Chief President, and Advocate-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral thank'd him for the great Confidence he repos'd in his Parliament, and promis'd to acquit themselves faithfully in what he had desir'd of them; but withal they humbly pray▪d him to find out some means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Malecontents by Clemency, rather than come to an open rupture with his Mother, and the greatest Lords of the Kingdom, and represented to him in a few Words the Calamities that attend a Civil War.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:187699:34"/>
               <p> After this the King nominated several Generals to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Male-contents in the several Provinces where they were canton'd; and to this end gave necessary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Governours of the neighbouring Provinces: The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was to command in the quality of Lieutenant-General the Army where the King was to be in Person: The Dukes of <hi>Guise</hi> and <hi>L'Esdigueres</hi> were appointed to oppose in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphiné</hi> the Designs of the Mareschal <hi>de Montmorenci,</hi> Governour of <hi>Languedoc:</hi> The Prince <hi>de Joinville,</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>de Themines</hi> were to make Head against the Dukes of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and <hi>Espernon:</hi> The Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Vitri</hi> had Orders to observe the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> Governour of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

He kept that Province in obedience, and hinder'd the Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> who had quitted the King's Service, from causing any Disorders there.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the King <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 7.</note> parted for <hi>Normandy,</hi> following the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Advice; although it was generally believ'd the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strong in those Parts, and therefore some of the most ancient Ministers endeavour'd to disswade him from it. He brought along with him his Brother the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and left the Queen with the Chancellor and some Counsellors of State at <hi>Paris.</hi> His Army consisted of no more than Eight thousand Foot, and Eight hundred Horse, reckoning his Guards in the number, and only carried with him Four Pieces of great Cannon, and Two Field-pieces. All this while the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> who was at <hi>Roan,</hi> was so little prepar'd to preserve that important City, that as soon as he receiv'd advice that the King's Army drew near, he went to the Parliament▪ protesting that he still preserv'd for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty all that Fidelity which he as Subject ow'd his Prince;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:187699:35"/> and that the only Reason of his withdrawing from Court, proceeded from the Favourites that abus'd the King's Goodness. After this he retir'd to <hi>Diepe,</hi> and the King was receiv'd at <hi>Roan</hi> with great Acclamations. The City of <hi>Caen</hi> immediately declar'd for his Majesty; and nothing but the Citadel, commanded by one <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> held out. The Mareschal <hi>de Pralin</hi> went to attack it in the usual Forms; and after he had made his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches pretty near it, he threatned the Captain to hang him and all his Men, if he did not immediately surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: But this Summons produc'd no effect; and they had been oblig'd to have lost several Days before it, if one <hi>Cailletau, Valet de Chambre</hi> to the King, had not cry'd out to the Soldiers, that the King would give them Ten thousand Crowns if they would leap down the Walls. The Captain fearing lest his Soldiers should be tempted by this Promise, did not make any farther opposition, but deliver'd the Citadel into the hands of the Besiegers. At the same time the Count <hi>de Matig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> one of the Malecontents, was gain'd over to the Royal Party by a Patent, to be a Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Beuvron,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,</hi> by Pensions which were promis'd them. Thus in a short time <hi>Normandy</hi> was entirely reduc'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Diepe,</hi> and some other places of small Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>The King and his Brother were some Days before the Citadel of <hi>Caen,</hi> where they visited the Trenches more than once, while the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> and others took such care of their persons as to keep at a distance. This made abundance of people talk sufpicious things of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Conduct, because it was not fit to expose the Lives of these Princes in such a place, since no body would have been a gainer by their Death, but himself alone. But after this good Success, which was the effect of his Advice, no one durst find fault with what he did. From that time he declar'd openly and without reserve, That the Queen-Mother ought to be made incapable of resisting the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for the future; although this was rather to revenge his own Imprisonment than to secure the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Re.</hi> T. 5. p. 129.</note> He pretended there was no regard due to that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:187699:35"/> Princess, although she was the King's Mother; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion had some Contests with the Cardinal <hi>de Rets,</hi> who was of the contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>After the King had made himself Master of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 18.</note> Citadel of <hi>Caen,</hi> it was debated whether he should return to <hi>Paris,</hi> or go on as he had begun. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> carri'd it in favour of this last Advice; and now they talk'd of going to <hi>Diepe,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was, or to <hi>Alençon,</hi> a place belonging to the Queen-Mother. <hi>Diepe,</hi> they thought, was too strongly fortified, and mann'd by too numerous a Garrison to be attack'd by so small an Army. By good fortune, while the matter was thus under deliberation, there came a Gentleman of the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> with a Letter from his Master address'd to the King, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that he would act nothing against his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but that his Enemies were too powerful at Court for him to appear there, as he had been order'd. They took this occasion not to go to <hi>Diepe;</hi> and the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to march streight into <hi>Anjou,</hi> where the Source of all these ill Humours lay. <hi>Alençon, Verneuil,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other places surrendred without any resistance; and the King did not condescend to make his entry into them, because he would not retard to no purpose the Progress of his Army. He left the Duke of <hi>Elheuf</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> lest the Malecontents should raise any new Disturbances there, after the departure of the Royal Army. But as 'twas imagin'd that <hi>Normandy</hi> would have diverted the King's Forces much longer, they were surpriz'd to see him march so suddenly by the side of <hi>Angérs,</hi> where they were not in a condition to defend themselves, though they pretended to be the first that should appear in the Field.</p>
               <p>A little before the Army march'd into <hi>Normandy,</hi> the King, as we have already observ'd, made offers of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with his Mother; but after several delays, she refus'd to come to a Treaty, unless all the Lords of her Party were present; which the King would by no means grant, because he would not seem to capitulate with his own Subjects. Nevertheless a Proposal was made to receive the Countess of <hi>Soissons</hi> into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, where she should represent those that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:187699:36"/> but when this Negotiation was on foot, the Queen receiv'd the News that the King's Army was marching into <hi>Normandy,</hi> which made her absolutely reject all manner of Propositions: Only she sent <hi>Blainville</hi> back to the King, to demand a Cessation of Arms for a Month, and that his Majesty would be pleas'd to return to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> thinking of nothing but how to act upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, till she saw him at the Head of his Army.</p>
               <p>The King did not listen to this, but arriv'd at <hi>Mans</hi> on the 30th of <hi>July;</hi> after which he enter'd into <hi>Anjou.</hi> In the mean time the Queen-Mother assembled all the Forces she was able to raise, having already got together Eight thousand Foot, and Fifteen hundred Horse. She expected the Troops which the Count <hi>de St. Aignan</hi> had rais'd on the other side the <hi>Loire</hi> in the Name of the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> and those which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was to bring from <hi>Poitou.</hi> She had fill'd, not only the Citadel of <hi>Angers,</hi> but the City and all places therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with Soldiers. For all this it was not believ'd she was safe in this place, and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> propos'd to her to retire into <hi>Guienne,</hi> where he was at the Head of Eighteen thousand Men. But the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who was afraid that he would over-top the other Heads of the Party, if he had the Queen once in his Power, hindred her from going thither, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to her Majesty, that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour'd to get her in his Hands, that so he might compound for himself more advantageously at Court at her Expence; that if she abandon'd <hi>Anjou</hi> at the approach of the Royal Army, the Party would lose its Reputation for ever, and that she would see all the Country between the <hi>Loire</hi> and the <hi>Garonne,</hi> which was entirely devoted to her, fall into the Enemies Hands without any one to oppose them; that it was better for her to continue still at <hi>Angers,</hi> and order the Troops of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and his own to come thither; which being joyn'd together, wou'd form a Body of twenty five thousand Men, without reckoning those which her Majesty already had; because with such a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army as this was, she would be in a condition to force the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> to accept her own Terms. This was excellent Advice, and had succeeded in all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:187699:36"/> probability if they had follow'd it; but the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> hindred the Queen from embracing it. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, as he had counsell'd her, to tarry at <hi>Angers,</hi> but would not suffer the Dukes of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and <hi>Espernon</hi> to bring their Men thither, under a pretence that she would have them look after their own Governments, which in their absence would be in danger to be lost. But the true Reason of it, as 'tis suppos'd, was this, that the Bishop could by no means endure that Two Persons of their Quality and Experience should be near the Queen, where they would certainly ruin that Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he had with her. Though he understood nothing of warlike Affairs, yet so long as there was no General of any Note at <hi>Angers,</hi> he was sure to be the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all that was done; which he could not have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in the least, if two Person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of that Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Experience as the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> and <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> were there. He fear'd, above all things, the free and disinterested Humour of the last, who had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question, sent him back to his Breviary, if he had presum'd to concern himself with the Deliberations of War in his Presence. Besides he desir'd that none but himself should be employ'd by the Queen-Mother, for this Reason, as People have since believ'd, that if she accommodated Matters, she would not fail to take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care of him; and that the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> who was oblig'd to him for weakning the Queen's Party af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, would perhaps make him some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. However it was, 'tis certain that by this advice he equally ruin'd the Affairs of the Queen, and of all those Gentlemen that oppos'd the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Mans</hi> the King advanc'd as far as <hi>La Fleche,</hi> where he stay'd till the fifth of <hi>August,</hi> expecting the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> Master of the Horse, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom he had dispatch'd to <hi>Angers</hi> to treat with his Mother. All the difficulty now remaining turn'd upon this Article, that the King refus'd to comprehend in the Treaty all those that had espous'd the Party of the Queen-Mother since the preceding Year 1619. except the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> because he was a Prince of the Blood. As for the rest, he expected they should throw
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:187699:37"/> themselves intirely upon his Generosity. This Clause principally affected the Two Brothers of <hi>Vendome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom they had incens'd the King in a most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner. On the other hand the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absolutely persisted to have all those that had taken Arms for her be compris'd in the Treaty, because if she abandon'd any one single Person, she would have none to act in her favour upon another occasion, and that she could never have too many Friends at Court where she had such powerful Enemies.</p>
               <p>The King, weary of attending the conclusion of the Treaty at <hi>la Fleche,</hi> which every one thought to be as good as concluded, advanc'd on the Evening of the sixth of <hi>August</hi> as far as <hi>Verger,</hi> and appointed the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous of his Army in the Plain of <hi>Trelassas,</hi> not far from the Slate-Pits of <hi>Angers:</hi> It consisted of Sixteen thousand Foot, and Three thousand Horse. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was Generalissimo, and the Mareschal <hi>de Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> Lieutenant-General. He had under him Three Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschals <hi>de Camp,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Trainel, Crequi, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restan,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Bassompierre.</hi> The King had Advice that the Treaty was signed, and expected every Minute to have it brought to him: But those that had the Treaty in their hands did not think fit to leave <hi>Angers</hi> till they had waited upon the Queen the next Morning, being the seventh of <hi>August,</hi> to know if her Majesty had any fresh Instructions to give them.</p>
               <p>While the King was thus expecting it, he order'd <hi>Crequi</hi> and <hi>Bassompierre,</hi> by way of Diversion as it were, to advance with the Guards, and the Regiments of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> to a small Village call'd <hi>Sorges,</hi> which is in sight of <hi>Pont du Cé,</hi> and try some Skirmishes with the Queen's Army, to discover their Retrenchments. This discovery might have been useful, in case the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation was broke, and it should be thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to attack that Post. The Troops march'd within sight of <hi>Pont du Cé,</hi> and fell upon Five thousand of the Queen's Men in their Retrenchments, put them in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and enter'd into the Town along with them. <note n="*" place="margin">See the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this Fight in the Memoirs of <hi>Bassompierre,</hi> T. 1. p. 496.</note> There was nothing now left but the Castle, which held out a few Hours, and then surrendred to <hi>Crequi,</hi> while <hi>Bassompierre</hi> went to acquaint the King with the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:187699:37"/> News of this Victory. The Grand Prior, the Dukes of <hi>Vendome</hi> and <hi>Rets,</hi> and the Vicount <hi>de Belancourt</hi> were in the Castle; but as soon as they saw the Cannon turn'd against them, they fled towards <hi>Angers</hi> in great Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation.</p>
               <p>The fight still continu'd, when the Duke of <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde</hi> arriv'd from <hi>Angers</hi> with the Treaty concluded and sign'd; and as he complain'd that they had attack'd the Queen's Forces, after the Conclusion of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he was answer'd, that 'twas his own fault, since he ought to have brought it without delay as soon as it was sign'd. The Royalists were glad that he did not come sooner, because this Defeat ruin'd the Queen's Party, and clearly dispirited them. Scarce any of their Heads shew'd either Bravery or Conduct upon this occasion: Among the rest the Duke of <hi>Rets</hi> was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly blamed, who was the first that fled into the Castle; from whence he retir'd to <hi>Angers:</hi> And when they made a shew of attacking that place, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself secure enough, he fled with Fifteen hundred Foot to <hi>Beaupreau,</hi> a small Dominion he had within some Leagues of that place. His Uncle, the Cardinal <hi>de Rets,</hi> went thither not long after to bring him to Court, where he was immediately receiv'd into favour, which induc'd people to believe, that the true Reason of this hasty flight, was because he knew the Agreement was made; and that he design'd by this means to purchase the King's Favour.</p>
               <p>The next <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>August</hi> 8.</note> Day the King entred into <hi>Pont du Cé,</hi> where he was surpriz'd to find the Shops open, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing as quiet as if there had been no Soldiers in the place: This shew'd that the People did not much concern themselves in these Quarrels, which solely proceeded from the King's Weakness, who could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between good and bad Counsels, and whom all the Grandees thought they had a right to govern. In the mean time the Queen was so terribly alarm'd at this defeat, that whereas before she would scarce accept of the most advantageous Conditions, now she thought it her Interest to comply with the King in whatever he desired. Nevertheless the King sent her Word, that she might ask for her self what she pleas'd, and that she
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:187699:38"/> should be received at Court with open Arms; but as for those that had taken up Arms for her, he pretended to make them know that he was their Master. Thus on the 9th. the Archbishop of <hi>Sens,</hi> the Master of the Horse, and Father <hi>Berulle,</hi> came to <hi>Pont du Ce,</hi> with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> Deputies for the Queen, to know his Majesty's Pleasure. He granted an Amnesty to all such as laid down their Arms within eighty Days, and return'd to their Duty; but he would by no means restore those who had been of the Queen's Party to their Offices, which were taken from them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War, and conferr'd upon others. He likewise confirm'd the Treaty of <hi>Angouleme,</hi> which I have already mention'd, and set the Prisoners of War at liberty, in favour of his Mother who desir'd it. There were some secret Articles, one of which was, That the King should demand a Cardinal's Cap of the Pope for the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> after he had obtain'd one for the Archbishop of <hi>Toulouse.</hi> And now when People saw the whole Body of the Malecontents ruin'd by the Advice of the former, the Queen oblig'd to return to Court, several Princes and Great Lords excluded out of the Treaty, or at least no Gainers by it, and only the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> who had tricked both Parties, distinguish'd from the rest of the Clergy, by the Promise of a Cardinal's Cap, they no longer doubted but that he had betray'd the Queen, who had been so wonderfully kind to him, to gain the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Duke of <hi>Luines.</hi> The King, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> and all the Court, receiv'd him with great Respect; because that if he had formerly hinder'd the Queen's return, yet he had afterwards made them amends, by reducing her to such Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that she was forced to buy her Reconciliation at any rate. All this while the poor Queen was not in the least aware of his Treachery; she procur'd him a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Cap, and admission into the Privy-Council, which were the Two things he chiefly aim'd at, and look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be the best Friend she had, till he persecuted her after the most unworthy manner in the World. She exprest a great deal of Joy at the Marriage between the Daughter of the Sieur <hi>de Pont-Courlai,</hi> the Bishop's Niece, and the Marquis <hi>de Cambalet,</hi> Son to the Duke
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:187699:38"/> of <hi>Luines</hi>'s Sister; which ought to have open'd her eyes, and convinc'd her that this Prelate kept a stricter Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with her Enemies than she imagin'd. Nay, she promised to give his Niece Two hundred thousand Livres for her Portion. By this instance we find that Observation made good, That Princes are generally so blinded in regard of their Favourites, that they are the last that perceive they are betray'd by them, and commonly when 'tis too late to preserve themselves from the Effects of their Treachery.</p>
               <p>The Treaty being thus concluded, the King came to <hi>Brissac,</hi> and the Queen-Mother hastened thither from <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug</hi> 15.</note>
                  <hi>Angers.</hi> His Majesty sent the Mareschal <hi>de Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> to receive her about the mid-way between <hi>Pont du Cé</hi> and <hi>Brissac;</hi> and went himself, with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Luines,</hi> to meet her some five hundred paces from <hi>Brissac.</hi> As soon as he saw her Litter, he alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Horse, and the Queen came out of her Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: They embraced one another with a great deal of Tenderness in all appearance; and the King told her in a jeasting way, that she should never escape out of his hands any more. The Queen replied, That it had been no difficult matter for him to have had her always about him, could she have hoped to be treated after such a manner, as a Son ought to treat his Mother. After this, she receiv'd the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with great Civility, and the Prince on his part paid her all the Respect that was due to her Character. When these Formalities were over, the Queen went to <hi>Chinon,</hi> and the King towards <hi>Poitiers,</hi> where he arrived on the Twentieth of this Month.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> had earnestly desir'd this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; because he began to fear, that if he any longer drew the Hatred of the most powerful and eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Kingdom upon him, they would find out a way of accommodating Matters with the King, by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him as they had done the Marquis <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> since he alone had occasion'd all these Disorders, and was as crying a Grievance as the unfortunate <hi>Concini.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had abundantly satisfied his Vengeance, by doing the Queen all the Mischief he could; and his Advices happen'd to have such good success, that the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:187699:39"/> King reposed an extraordinary Confidence in him: But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1619"/> finding she was now to live with her Son afresh, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd as well as <hi>Luines</hi> to gain her Good-will, by perswading his Majesty to grant her all that she asked of him. Both of 'em seem to have join'd the Bishop of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon</hi> in their Interests by the Promise which they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the King to make him; and the Bishop had still so great a Reputation with the Queen, that they were in hopes they had nothing to fear from that Quarter.</p>
               <p>The Court sent the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> as being his Cousin, to discourse him as from himself, and engage him to lay down his Arms. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> likewise pray'd the Archbishop of <hi>Sens,</hi> who was a particular Friend of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to talk with him in his Name. <hi>Luines</hi> offer'd very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Conditions to him, <hi>viz.</hi> to bestow one of his Nieces upon his Son the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> with a present of Two hundred thousand Crowns which the King would give her; to make him both a Duke and a Peer, by erecting <hi>la Valette</hi> into a Dutchy and Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; to give the Son of <hi>Espernon</hi> the Survivorship of his Father's Offices, besides the Promise of a Cardinal's Cap to the Archbishop of <hi>Toulouse;</hi> to give a Gratuity in Money to the Captains of the Guards who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him to <hi>Metz,</hi> in consideration that their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were taken from them; and lastly, out of respect to him to grant several other remarkable Favours. As for the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> they promised him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Bearn,</hi> which they design'd to take away from the Count <hi>de la Force,</hi> a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> who at that time enjoy'd it. Nevertheless, he was still of the Opinion not to lay down Arms, till the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> was ruin'd; and had certainly persisted in it, if after he had sent to the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to know his Resolutions, he had not found them to be quite different from his. The latter having only taken up Arms to serve the Queen-Mother, now she had concluded a Treaty with her Son, thought it his wisest course to make his Peace in time; and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> came at last to be perswaded, that it was his Interest so to do, and not pretend to oppose the King's Forces by himself, who would infallibly over-power him. Thus this formidable Tempest, which seem'd to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:187699:39"/> threaten the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> so severely, and which one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1620"/> would have thought 'twas impossible to dissipate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shedding a world of Blood, was entirely dispers'd, by the ill success of one inconsiderable Skirmish.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, the Queen and Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> sent an Express to <hi>Rome,</hi> to inform the Pope of what had past, and at the same time to demand a Cardinal's Cap: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he durst not ask to have the First Promotion made in his Favour, because it had been expresly demanded for the Archbishop of <hi>Toulouse.</hi> In the mean time, those very Persons who in appearance had chearfully promis'd to contribute all their Assistance towards the Bishop's Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, were now grown cold in the Business. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was not so heartily reconcil'd to the Queen-Mother, as to love her Creatures, and rejoice at their Preferment. The Chancellor, the Keeper of the Seals, and the Marquis <hi>de Puysieux,</hi> were far from wishing well to the Bishop; and besides, were afraid of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admission into the Council, from whence he had been expell'd by force: And as for the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> though he was shortly to be allied to him, yet he apprehended the preferring so intriguing and ambitious a Man as this Prelate was.</p>
               <p>This was the reason why the Court did not sollicite at <hi>Rome</hi> to get a Cardinal's Cap for him with that vigour as they had formerly done. Nay, <hi>Luines</hi> made no scruple to acquaint <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> the Nuncio with the Mystery of this Secret, that so the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and not believe that the King did earnestly desire it. He assur'd him, That his Majesty had been oblig'd to name the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> for a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, out of pure complaisance to the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, altho' he did not in the least desire the Pope to take any notice of it: That it was only for a show, that they had order'd the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres,</hi> Ambassadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> to move in this Affair; and that the true reason why they did not communicate this Secret to him, was to carry on the Sham the better: That the King had dispatch'd an Agent to oppose it in private, because he look'd upon it to be a reflection on his Honour, to buy the Peace he had made with his Mother, of the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> by raising him to the Purple; besides, that he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:187699:40"/> had several other Reasons not to love him. The Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> and <hi>Puysieux</hi> earnestly desir'd the Nuncio to hold his tongue upon this occasion, and to see that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should not take air at <hi>Rome;</hi> because if either the Queen or the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> should ever arrive to the knowledge of it, it might occasion great Disorders, not only at Court, but all over the Kingdom, this Prelate being absolute Master of the Queen's Inclinations, and having been in a great measure the cause of all those Troubles that were so lately concluded. To this <hi>Puysieux</hi> added, That although his Majesty had a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand two Caps, yet at present he would be content with one; and that let the Ambassadour say what he would, they should not regard it: That the reason why they conceal'd all this from him, was, because his nearest Relations had been engaged in the Queen-Mother's Party. However, says <hi>Puysieux</hi> to the Nuncio, the King would not be so misunderstood, as if he design'd to have his Ambassadour be ever the less <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> respected in the other Functions of his Place, since this was a particular Article by it self, to which the rest had no manner of relation.</p>
               <p>Not long after this happen'd, the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> sent an Ecclesiastick to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Ministers, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to impose upon this Prelate, gave him Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to the Ambassadour. The Queen prest this Affair very warmly to the Nuncio; who answer'd her, That as <hi>France</hi> might pretend to one Cap with a great deal of probability of obtaining it; so he very much question'd whether the Pope would grant two; nevertheless, he promised to write to <hi>Rome</hi> about it, as her Majesty desired him.</p>
               <p>The Reconciliation of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was as good as effected; and the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> seem'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly desirous of that Alliance which he had propos'd to him: All the rest of the Faction was dispers'd; nor indeed was there any tolerable Agreement between those who had appear'd the most zealous for the support of that Party; only the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> threatned to throw himself among the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> in case they pushed Matters too far; and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> out of fear of losing his Government, talked after the same manner:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:187699:40"/> But this was soon over, and they submitted themselves to his Majesty's Generosity. On the 27th of <hi>August</hi> a Declaration of his Majesty was confirm'd in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the Queen-Mother was declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
               <p>About this time the Nuncio used all his Interest to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> to turn his Arms against the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and though this Minister seem'd to disapprove of it, yet there were so many Persons at Court that back'd this Demand, that it was resolved from that very Year to begin to strike at the whole Body; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed, as we shall find in the Series of this History. Some fresh Conversation happen'd about the Promotion of the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> when <hi>Luines</hi> repeated the same things to the Nuncio; adding, That if this Prelate were once made a Cardinal, it was to be fear'd he would make no other use of this new Dignity, than to cabal more successfully for the Queen-Mother, and highly complain'd of his Ingratitude: He had deliver'd him, as he said, from danger of his Life, when the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> was kill'd; he had sent for him to wait upon the Queen; he had caus'd him to be re-call'd from <hi>Aeignon,</hi> and placed him the second time near the Person of that Princess; and yet all the return he made him for these Kindnesses, was to be one of the forwardest to conspire his Destruction. In short, he told him that his Majesty resolved to see how he carried himself before he stirr'd for him: That as for himself, he should be glad to see the Fruits of the Alliance he was going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with him; and lastly, that several Years hence it would be soon enough to promote him to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Court dispatch'd a Messenger soon after to <hi>Bearn,</hi> to tell the Governour of that Province, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Pau,</hi> That the King's Pleasure was, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion should be set up again in <hi>Bearn,</hi> and that the Church-men should be restor'd to their ancient Possessions <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Octob.</hi>
                  </note>. The King's Commissioners soon return'd with the News that his Majesty should be obey'd; which was confirm'd by the Deputies of <hi>Bearn,</hi> who arrived a few days after at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But the King told them his meaning was, that his Declaration for the Re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Religion in <hi>Bearn,</hi> should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in the Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> and perform'd before his return to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Deputies, follow'd by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss <hi>de la Force,</hi> and the Chief President of <hi>Pau,</hi> made their appearance at Court; but did not bring with them the Confirmation which the King demanded. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, his Majesty, without farther delay, order'd his Army to advance towards <hi>Bearn,</hi> and marched thither himself. He met no manner of resistance there; so that he caused his Declaration to be register'd, and Mass to be said where he pleased. 'Twas observable, that it was celebrated on the 19th. of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Navarrin,</hi> which was the very same Day on which Queen <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> had Fifty Years ago suppress'd it. What was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be remark'd, is, That there were no Catholicks to hear it, but only such as the King had brought along with him; because in so long an interval, that Race was quite extinguish'd in this Country. So that it may truly be said, That the King establish'd the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the use of the Church-Walls, and not the People of <hi>Bearn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King return'd to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:187699:41"/> the Catholick Religion in <hi>Bearn</hi> might probably occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Another Express was sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to acquaint the Pope with these Occurrences, but especially to press the Promotion which had been demanded of him. The Queen-Mother came first to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King also arriv'd at the beginning of the following <note n="*" place="margin">Noves</note> Month; but the News of his coming was not known, till he was at the Gates of the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> sent for his Niece to come to Court, who was promised to <hi>Combalet,</hi> Nephew to the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> to conclude the Marriage there. The Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> who did not think it was now his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to unite himself to the Bishop by this Alliance, went to the Queen to know whether she desired it, being resolved to break off the Match, in case her Majesty dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved of it. But the Queen so positively assured him, that it was necessary for himself to be more closely linked with the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> that the Duke was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he could not start back from it. Thus, on the 26th. of <hi>November,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de la Rochefoucaut</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Marquiss <hi>de Cambalet,</hi> to Madamoiselle <hi>de Pont Courlay,</hi> in the Queen-Mother's Chamber, in presence of the King, Queen, Princes, Princesses, and several other Persons of the highest Quality at Court. Besides the Portion already mentioned, the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on the new-married Bride above the value of Twelve thousand Crowns in Jewels and other things; which Liberality the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> and his Relations very sorrily requited afterwards.</p>
               <p>As soon as this Marriage was concluded, the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> alter'd his Measures, and prest the Bishop of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon</hi>'s Promotion at <hi>Rome,</hi> with as much earnestness as he had opposed it before. The Court of <hi>France</hi> now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two Caps; one for the Archbishop of <hi>Toulouse,</hi> and the other for the Bishop of <hi>Luçon:</hi> But for fear the Pope should make the First Promotion, and take no notice of the latter, the Queen dispatch'd a Courier expresly to <hi>Rome,</hi> with so much precipitation, that she would not stay for Letters of Recommendation from <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> the Nuncio, to Cardinal <hi>Borghese,</hi> though she had earnestly desir'd them. The Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> also to press this affair, writ to <hi>Marsillac</hi> the King's Agent, to act chiefly in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:187699:42"/> favour of the Bishop of <hi>Luçon.</hi> As it was altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Duke to have the Queen-Mother his Friend, he every day united himself more strictly to her Favourite; who being supported by that Princess's Authority, sollicited his own Elevation to the Purple, with that Zeal and Application, that one might very well see he would never be at ease, till he had receiv'd satisfaction in this point. The Queen-Mother spoke about it to the Nuncio as often as she saw him; and the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres,</hi> who knew nothing of this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi>'s Opinion, but had all along sollicited heartily for the Bishop, urged it now more than ever, thinking the Pope would certainly make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion before <hi>Christmas:</hi> Which however did not fall out according to his expectation, because his Holiness found it convenient to defer this matter a few days longer. The more the Pope retarded it, the more did the Bishop's Hopes encrease, because the Queen-Mother had more time to set all Wheels a-going, that might procure him this Cap he so passionately desired. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Ministers, but especially <hi>Puysieux,</hi> only serv'd him by halves; and Father <hi>Arnoux</hi> endeavour'd to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the King with a Scruple upon this score, as if it were a sin to reward the Instrument of all the past Commotions. But the Authority of the Queen-Mother, and that of her Favourite, carried it in spight of the Confessor and all the Council.</p>
               <p>Thus the Ambassadour at <hi>Rome</hi> frequently receiv'd new Orders to recommend this Affair to the Pope and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1621"/> the Cardinal-Patron, who having in the interim been, as 'tis commonly reported, advertis'd by <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> That his Majesty did only outwardly seem to countenance the matter, which was kept as a Secret from the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, return'd him no positive Answer. The Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that having no more than Ten Caps to bestow, he could not grant Two of them to <hi>France,</hi> as he would have done in case there had been Eighteen Vacancies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had a great Inclination to give all manner of Satisfaction to that Crown. Cardinal <hi>Borghese</hi> very well propos'd to make a Promotion of Ten Cardinals, and to give one of the two next Caps that fell, to the Bishop of <hi>Luçon.</hi> But this Proposition was rejected by the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:187699:42"/> and the Cardinal-Patron grew colder every day. The Ambassadour perceiving this, could not forbear to testifie his Resentments, and openly protested, that his Master would use all the means he had in his hands to revenge this Refusal. However, before he came to a publick Rupture, he sent word to the Cardinal-Patron, That the King having for so long a time made so many repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Instances to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to grant him what he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was engaged in Honour to obtain it; and that if he were denied, he would not fail to shew his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, by something that should mortifie the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> demanded to have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Pope, to make his last Efforts upon his Holiness. Having <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 10.</note> obtain'd it, he began to sound the Pope's Inclinations, whom he found more resolute than ever to refuse him the Two Caps, and the Promotion of the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> without being able to bring him to any Temperament to satisfie the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> At last he thought himself oblig'd to leave in the hands of his Holiness a <note n="*" place="margin">See it in <hi>Siri, Mem.

The Pope ask'd him whether there was any thing in it injurious to his Person: And the Ambassadour answer'd him, That without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the permission of the King his Master, he would submit himself to the Justice of his Holiness, if he found the least offensive Term in it. Hereupon the Pope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of him how he came to speak with so much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Bishop of <hi>Luçon? Coeuvres</hi> frankly told him, That he had express Orders for so doing; and for a proof of what he attested, took out of his Pocket a Letter from the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> wherein he inform'd him, that the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> having contributed more than any one to the good Intelligence between the King and the Queen his Mother; and that having besides contracted an Alliance with him by the Marriage of his Niece, he found himself oblig'd to intreat him to employ all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable means to obtain a Cardinal's Cap for that Bishop; nay, to hinder the Archbishop of <hi>Toulouse</hi> from being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted without him. To this the Pope replied, that he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:187699:43"/> had a Letter under the King's own Hand, which direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed the preferment of this Prelate. At these Words the Ambassadour was struck dumb, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to the highest degree at this Usage, and at the little Confidence the King and his Favourite repos'd in him. He could not forbear to discover part of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments to his Holiness, because he did not acquaint him with this Mystery before, which had saved him a great deal of unnecessary trouble. He likewise complain'd mightily of the Court, and of the affront which had been put upon him; and desired the King to re-call him from a place where he could not continue any longer with Honour. But outwardly he observ'd the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and daily prest for the Bishop, though without any hopes; because this Prelate could not be promoted, without excluding <hi>Stephen Pignatelli,</hi> a great Favourite of Cardinal <hi>Borghese,</hi> for being the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri,</hi> ibid. p. 243.</note> Minister of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Pleasures, as it was commonly said in <hi>Rome:</hi> In that Writing of this Ambassadour, he is represented as a Man extreamly scandalous, even in a place where one must commit very great Disorders to make the People exclaim against him, who are accustomed to have a greater Indulgence to Churchmen, than in other places. However, the Pope held a Consistory * the next day, and <note place="margin">

               <p> The King having received the News of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Promotion, it was thought more convenient to make the best Advantage of the present Conjuncture, than to shew too much Resentment, since at last the Pope had done nothing, but what was conformable to the first Orders of his Majesty. However, he took occasion to complain of this Procedure to Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> at the next Audience he gave him.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Ludovisio</hi> succeeded <hi>Paul</hi> V. having been ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted twelve <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 9.</note> days after, and took the Name of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> XV. This caused some alteration in the Instances which the Court made for the Bishop of <hi>Luçon;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this Disappointment did not much dishearten him, and he was promised to be considered in the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
               <p>Towards the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> was declared Constable of <hi>France,</hi> and the <note n="*" place="margin">April</note> King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Ceremony with great Solemnity, without minding the Murmurs of the Court, who were disgusted to see the Constable's Sword in the hands of one who understood nothing at all of War. The Duke of <hi>Lesdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueres</hi> had been made to expect it, at the time when it was fear'd he would appear at the head of the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Luines</hi> having begged it for himself, <hi>Lesdigueres</hi> was forc'd to sit down content with a Patent for being a Mareschal of <hi>France.</hi> Nevertheless, he was order'd to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had the Title given him of <hi>Mestre de Camp General</hi> of the King's Armies; by virtue of which, he was as it were a Lieutenant to the Constable.</p>
               <p>About the same time the Court received Advice of the Insurrection of the People of <hi>Bearn,</hi> who were not able to suffer any longer the re-establishment of the Catholick Religion in their Country, occasion'd by the Indiscretion of the Missionaries, and the Catholicks that were left behind there. It was resolved to set all things in order with all possible speed; and pursuant to <hi>Bassompier</hi>'s Counsel, this Commission was given to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who had a natural Aversion to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and besides, was glad of so fair an Opportunity to signalize his Fidelity, which was suspected by reason of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he had done the Queen-Mother. As soon as ever
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:187699:44"/> he had receiv'd the King's Orders, he us'd so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that he had gotten a considerable body of Men together, whom he had rais'd at his own Expence, or whom the respect they had for his Person, had engag'd to follow him in this Enterprize, before the Marquis <hi>de la Force</hi> was in a condition to defend himself. Having thus entred <hi>Bearn,</hi> instead of meeting any Opposition, he found that upon the Report of his coming thither, they had abandon'd all their Towns and Villages, and fled to the Mountains. The City of <hi>Ortes,</hi> which was fortified by a good Castle, open'd their Gates immediately to him, without so much as staying till the Cannon were brought against them. <hi>Oleron</hi> did the same; and the Marquis <hi>de la Force</hi> was oblig'd to quit the Province, lest he should fall into the Hands of the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi> Thus <hi>Bearn</hi> was reduc'd without any Effusion of Blood, and the Duke ordering his Army to observe an exact Discipline, those that had retir'd into the Woods and Mountains, came back again to their Houses.</p>
               <p>The Proceedings of the last Year, and this in <hi>Bearn,</hi> had extreamly alarm'd the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and as their Churches had been burnt at <hi>Tours, Poitiers,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, by the Mob who were incens'd against them, they began to understand that a Design was form'd to divest them of those Priviledges which they enjoy'd by the Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi> In short, if such a Resolution as this was not taken; yet 'tis evident by what follows, that the Court did not think themselves at all oblig'd to keep their Word with them, and that the Declarations which were frequently publish'd in their Favour, only proceeded from the Fears they were in of raising a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, and not at all from any Principle of Equity. The King, who was extreamly devout, rather through a weakness of Mind than solid Knowledge, had no more Religion than was just put into his Head, nor no more Justice and Clemency than those that were near his Person thought it requisite to let him have: Thus his Confessor and the Ecclesiasticks about him did easily persuade him to do what they would have him, but especially against the Hereticks. The <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who were soon sensible of this, thought themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to use all necessary Precautions that the Enemy
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:187699:44"/> might not surprize them at a disadvantage, when they were not upon their guard; and as all their Strength wholly consisted in their being united, they summon'd a general Assembly to meet on the 20th of <hi>November</hi> 1620. to agree about what was to be done, in case they were attack'd. The King condemn'd this Assembly, and order'd them to break up; but they did not think fit to obey the Royal Mandate. They made some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private regulations; but all their Measures, which only tended to preserve their own Priviledges, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be Overt Acts of Rebellion; so that now 'twas openly attempted to ruin them, though at the same time they protested that they would religiously observe the Edict of <hi>Nantz.</hi> I will not enter into the particulars of these Broils, in which the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> had no concern at that time, although a final stop was put to them under his Ministry: It will be sufficient to describe, in a few Words, the Progress which the Court made against the Malecontents, because it was upon this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> acted against the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> when he was chief Minister of State. The Edict of <hi>Nantz</hi> had granted to them a considerable number of Cities of Security, where they were tolerated to have Governours of their own Religion, and these Cities were as it were Pledges for the Promise that was made them, to observe the Edict inviolably. Now as they plainly saw that it was daily infring'd; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Court alledged to the contrary, that they were searching means to wrest these Places out of their Hands, in order to treat them afterwards at discretion, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to defend themselves vigorously, and to retaliate upon the Catholicks for the Insolences they had sustain'd from them. The better to effect this, they were in readiness almost in all places to take up Arms, and did not fail to revenge themselves to the utmost for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries receiv'd.</p>
               <p>This was sufficient to put the Court upon a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to employ open Force, to turn them out of these strong Holds, under pretence of Rebellion. After se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Advances, which I shall not stay to mention here, the King being at <hi>Saumur,</hi> was inform'd that the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was one of the principal Heads of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:187699:45"/>
                  <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and who was afterwards declar'd General of all their Forces, caus'd some new Fortifications to be made at <hi>St. Jean d' Angely,</hi> a City of <hi>Saintonge,</hi> which was one of their places of Security. He immediately sent Orders to him to leave off, and to come to him, with <hi>Soubise</hi> his Brother. But the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to obey this Command, considering what he had so lately done; so the King resolv'd to open the Campain with the Siege of this Place. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had put three thousand Men in Garrison, and left his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to command in the place, with the Advice of an experienc'd Soldier, whose Name was <hi>Haute Fontaine.</hi> He had sufficiently provided it with all manner of Stores, both of Provision and Ammunition; so that it held out longer than was expected. It was invested on the 18th of <hi>May,</hi> by some Troops which the King had left in <hi>Poitou,</hi> at his return from <hi>Bearn.</hi> The King appear'd in Person before it, with his whole Army, commanded, under his Orders, by the Mareschal <hi>de Lesdigueres,</hi> and by the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who receiv'd his Orders from none but the King; his Son, the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> performing the Function of Colonel of the <hi>Frénch</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, that so his Father, to whom that Post belong'd, might not be oblig'd to obey the Duke <hi>de Lesdigueres</hi> in that quality. However the place held out till the 16th of <hi>June,</hi> and then surrendred upon condition that the King should pardon all those that were in the place, leaving them at liberty, and in possession of their Estates and Priviledges, granted to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> by the Edict of <hi>Nantz.</hi> There was not a House left entire in the whole City, the Cannon having either destroy'd or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damag'd them all; and, to compleat its Misfortunes, the King condemn'd the place to be dismantled.</p>
               <p>After this, the Royal Army reduc'd several small Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either by Terror, as <hi>St. Foi,</hi> and <hi>Bergerac,</hi> or else by Force, as <hi>Clerac;</hi> while the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> made the same Progress in <hi>Berry,</hi> and along the <hi>Loire;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> acted the same in <hi>High Guienne.</hi> But the most memorable Siege was that of <hi>Montauban.</hi> This City was invested on the 17th of <hi>August,</hi> and the King appear'd in Person before it the same day. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable <hi>de Luines</hi> commanded the Army, and had for his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:187699:45"/> Lieutenant-Generals his Brothers, and the Dukes of <hi>Mayenne, Chevreuse,</hi> and <hi>Lesdigueres.</hi> The Count <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> Superintendant of the Finances, was Grand Master of the Artillery, and besides perform'd the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Lieutenant-General. Three Attacks were made, the first of which was that of the King, commanded by the Constable and his Brothers; the second that of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne;</hi> the third that of <hi>Chevreuse</hi> and <hi>Lesdigueres.</hi> The place was attack'd with the greatest Vigour imaginable; but it was as well defended by the Marquis <hi>de la Force,</hi> and by the Count <hi>d'Orval,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> who commanded there with a good Garrison, assisted by the Burghers, who shew'd no less Bravery upon this occasion than the Soldiers. <note n="*" place="margin">See the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This News being brought them by the Officer, who escap'd, as it were, by Miracle, through all their Firing, hindred them from pursuing their Design, wherein they most certainly had lost abundance of Men. The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who kept the Field with a small Body of Men, put some Relief into the place, under the Conduct of one <hi>Beaufort;</hi> and this, together with the frequent Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Enemy, and the continual Losses they sustain'd, made them resolve to raise the Siege, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did on the first Day of <hi>November.</hi> Orders were given in all the Quarters, that at the first discharge of a Cannon they heard that Night, every one should put himself in Arms, to march where he was commanded, and that before they parted they should make great Fires on all sides. When this was put in Execution, the Besieged expected they would give a general Assault, so that they contented themselves to guard their respective Posts, while the King's Army dislodged, without falling upon their Rear.</p>

               <p> After this manner the Siege was rais'd, in which they lost a great number of brave Soldiers, and persons of Quality, among whom was the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who was kill'd with a Musquet-Shot which he receiv'd in his Eye. It is not known to what the ill Success of this Siege is to be attributed, where the King in Person was attended by the most experienc'd Generals, and the best appointed Troops of his Kingdom, that did not seem to want any thing. For although 'tis certain that the Besieg'd behav'd themselves with all the Gallantry imaginable, yet in all Appearance, since they did not spare their Men upon this occasion, they must unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably have carried the Place, which after all was not regularly fortified.

               <p>All the Winter was spent in thinking of Ways and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1622"/> Means to continue the War against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which all the bigotted Catholicks, or such as pretended to be so, advis'd the King to carry on, without giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self any trouble for the Welfare of the State, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requir'd a Peace than a continuation of the War, which carried off infinite numbers of Men, in almost all the Provinces of the Kingdom. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was one of those that declaim'd most zealously against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> though it is hard to divine the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this Indignation. Hitherto he had not given Proofs of so great a Devotion, as to induce People to believe that it was his Zeal for Religion that put him
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:187699:46"/> upon it. Neither did his Experience, Courage, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1622"/> Conduct in War, as 'tis imagin'd, engage him in this Affair, since he did not possess those Qualities in a very eminent Degree, considering what others he had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him. And then as for the repose of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the frequent Commotions he rais'd will not suffer us to believe that he set that very much to Heart. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem Recond.</hi> T. p. 404.</note> A certain person, in whom he repos'd an extraordinary confidence, told a Prelate, that it was foretold to this Prince, That at the Age of Thirty four Years he should be King of <hi>France;</hi> and that being then Thirty three Years old, he was glad to see himself at the Head of an Army, to be in a better condition to support his Right, till the fatal time arriv'd of his being crown'd. Upon a like Prediction, he had formerly taken up Arms, under the Regence of the Queen-Mother; and 'tis not improbable but that he relaps'd into the same Weakness: Those that can suffer themselves to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd with such Chimera's, being subject to commit the same Fault often. However it was, the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> only Brother to the King, having been at Death's Door the Year before, which the King too did not pass without a Fit of Sickness, the Prince fancied he ought always to be in a readiness to take the Crown, if these Two Princes happen'd to die. Nay, 'tis said, that he design'd to expose them in this War, that so the Crown might come the sooner to him.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother was not as yet readmitted into the Council since her return to Court; for the King was apprehensive, that if once he gave her footing there, he must share his Authority with her; which he firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to part with none but his Favourites that always manag'd him. Nevertheless, upon the Advice of his Ministers, he at last granted this Satisfaction to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lest she should underhand cross the Designs of the Court, in case they continu'd to refuse her a thing which she so passionately desir'd. Besides this might serve to counterpoise the Authority of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who would become too powerful if the King continu'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Favourite that would concern himself with Affairs of State. Thus his Majesty consented that the Queen-Mother should have admission into the Council, but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:187699:47"/> would not suffer the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> to bear her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany thither, because he saw the Ministers were resolv'd to oppose the Pretensions of this Prelate, whose ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and meddling Humour they fear'd. The Queen seem'd to be extreamly satisfied with the Honour her Son had done her, hoping, that when once she had got ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into the Council, she might be able in time to introduce whom she pleas'd, and particularly the Bishop of <hi>Luçon;</hi> for whose Preferment she testified upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions a most extraordinary Zeal. After the Death of the Constable <hi>de Luines,</hi> no body had press'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of this Prelate at <hi>Rome,</hi> because neither the King, nor his Ministers desir'd it in the least, unless the Queen-Mother had taken care to importune all the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Score. She writ several times to the Pope and his Nephew about it, and was continually speaking of it to the Nuncio, the King, and the Ministers. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the King, who was naturally distrustful, and had long ago imbib'd a deep Prejudice against the Bishop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> reassum'd his old Conduct, and told the Nuncio <hi>Corfini,</hi> that although he still continu'd to demand the Promotion of this Prelate, yet he should not be sorry if they took no notice of this demand at <hi>Rome,</hi> provided the Pope did not bestow this Cap upon any Enemy of <hi>France.</hi> To the end that this Secret might not take vent, it was concluded, that the Commandeur <hi>de Sillery,</hi> who succeeded the Marquis <hi>de Caeuvres,</hi> as Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at <hi>Rome,</hi> should know nothing of the matter; and that when the Promotion was over, out of which the Bishop was to be excluded, the King should pretend to be offended at it, and write to his Ambassador to testifie his Resentments of it to the Pope.</p>
               <p>But a few Days after, this Design being discover'd by the Queen-Mother, in all appearance, through the means of one of Cardinal <hi>Ludovisio</hi>'s Domesticks, the King was so highly incens'd at it, that he dispatch'd a Courier to the Ambassador to tell him, That he must inform the Pope and Cardinal Patron, that what the Nuncio had lately written, as in the King's Name, was false, and to use all imaginable diligence to procure a Cap for the Bishop of <hi>Luçon.</hi> Thus that Affair, which in all probability would have destroy'd the Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:187699:47"/> of this Prelate, gave him greater hopes of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now than ever.</p>
               <p>While the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> thus busied himself with his own particular Interests, Proposals of Peace were made, which might, to the great advantage of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have put a stop to the Civil War, if the King had been pleas'd to listen to them. All that the other Party demanded, was inviolably to observe the Edict of <hi>Nantz,</hi> and to leave all things in the same Posture as they were in at the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. But the Ministers could not suffer the King to stay at <hi>Paris,</hi> for fear lest some new Favourite should take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the State out of their Hands. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the Court-Flatterers were still buzzing it into the King's Ears, that he was not Master of his own Dominions, so long as any part of them was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the Royal Jurisdiction; so they hoped to reduce the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to such a pass, as to depend abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely upon the King's good Pleasure, or rather that of his Favourites, Enemies to all Equity and Laws, whose Caprices this mistaken Prince took for the Rule of his Conduct. The Ecclesiasticks, who have an implacable Aversion to all such as presume to touch their Authority or Revenues, earnestly sollicited the King not to lose this opportunity of exterminating the Hereticks. What fell out unluckily for the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> some of the Nobility that were of their Religion, fearing to be overwhelm'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ruins of the Party, abandon'd them at a time when they had the greatest occasion for them. Nor was this all the Mischief that befel them, for their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals could not endure, that not only the Assemblies of their Noblemen, but what was more unpalatable, that their very Synods should pretend to concern themselves with the management of the War, though the Persons that compos'd them understood nothing of the Matter. To this may be added that there was little or no recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to be hop'd for from a sort of Anarchy, as in effect their Confederacy was; whereas the King was in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to give them the greatest Rewards, and yet they ran no Risque to obtain them. This brought off the Dukes of <hi>Sully, Bouillon,</hi> and <hi>Lesdigueres,</hi> the Count <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> and several more of eminent Note from their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:187699:48"/> Party; some of whom turn'd Catholicks afterwards. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1622"/> These were the greatest Inconveniences the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had to fear, and the greatest Reason which occasion'd them to have the worst in the course of this War, as will appear by what I am going to relate, though I do not design to stop at Particulars of small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>As the King had no Revenues, during these intestine Broils, out of those places, where the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were strongest, it was necessary to think of some new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to raise Money for the continuance of the War. He publish'd several Edicts, for the creation of new Offices, and for an Imposition of some Taxes. These Edicts being sent to the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Parliament made a difficulty to ratifie some of them, as being contrary to Justice and the Welfare of the Kingdom. But these Reasons were out of Doors, when the King * came in Person to the Parliament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <note place="margin">
                     <hi>March</hi> 18.</note> by Monsieur his Brother, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> Princes of the Blood. The Prince of <hi>Joinville,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Vendome,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords and Officers of the Crown. The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor having represented in the King's Name the pressing Necessities of the State, and commanded these Edicts to be read aloud, they fell to voting, and no one durst op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the King's Pleasure in his Presence, so that these Edicts were enroll'd and registred.</p>
               <p>After this the King resolv'd to go into <hi>Britany</hi> to stop the Progress of the Duke of <hi>Soubise,</hi> who had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of several Posts in <hi>Low Poitou,</hi> and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to threaten that Province. He parted on the 20th of <hi>March,</hi> and arriv'd ot <hi>Nantz</hi> the 10th of <hi>April,</hi> where a general Rendezvous of the Army was made. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was Lieutenant-General of it, and it consisted of about ten thousand Foot, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse. <hi>Soubise</hi> had got but a very inconsiderable Body of Men together, which was not half so numerous as that of the King; so that he thought it his safest way to retire to the Isle of <hi>Rhee.</hi> But as he was not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, either for Courage or Conduct, to his Brother the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:187699:49"/> being now in the King's Camp, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Constables Sword on the 29th of <hi>August;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Marquis <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> had the King's Word to be made Mareschal of <hi>France</hi> in his Place, which was not executed till six Weeks after. Since the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> offer'd to lay down their Arms in all places, if the King would grant them an Amnesty for what was past, and Liberty of Conscience for the future, which they had till then enjoy'd, it was imagin'd that a Peace would be immediately concluded; but an unexpected Obstacle interven'd, which was as follows. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Montpellier</hi> offer'd to receive the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mem. Bassomp▪</hi> p. 241.</note> Constable <hi>de Lesdigueres</hi> into the Town, with such Forces as he should think convenient, provided that the King would keep himself at ten Leagues distance from them. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this was, because the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Peace which was then on foot, had given out in several Places, that if the King entred into <hi>Montpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> he would see it should be pillag'd, whatever care was taken to the contrary. The <hi>Hugonots</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of this, stipulated, that the Constable might come and take Possession there in the King's Name, and that his Majesty would keep off. The greatest part of his Majesty's Council were of Opinion, that it would be the best way to grant their Demand, since at the bottom the King would be no less Master of the City; but the Advice of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> supported by <hi>Bassompierre,</hi> carried it; who pretended, that it was incompatible with his Majesty's Honour to see himself resus'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into a City which belong'd to him, by his own Subjects. But at last, after a Siege of six Weeks, in which the Royal Army lost a world of Men, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> prevail'd with the Inhabitants of <hi>Montpellier</hi> to receive the King. What helped to facilitate this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation was, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> begg'd leave of the King to make a Voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> pretending that the Constable <hi>de Lesdigueres</hi> was expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Camp, and that he could not frame himself to be under his Orders: But after all, the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it was, because he saw it was impossible for him to hinder the conclusion of the Peace. In effect the King having promis'd those of <hi>Montpellier</hi> what they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:187699:50"/> demanded; they consented that he should come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, provided he left no Garrison behind him at his departure, so he made his entry into it on the 20th. of <hi>October.</hi> All the Articles were punctually observ'd but the last, the King leaving two Regiments in Garrison when he went. But the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were too weary of the War, to take up Arms again for the infraction of this Article.</p>
               <p>The King's Naval Forces, Commanded by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> had likewise great advantages this Year over the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> whom they lock'd up by Land by <hi>Fort-Lewis,</hi> and several other Forts, which were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Ruin, as we shall see hereafter. But the Peace concluded at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> put the <hi>Rochellers</hi> out of a condition of fearing any ill Effects from the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Victory: Nay, it was promised the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to demolish <hi>Fort-Lewis;</hi> but it appear'd by the effects, that the Court had no design to keep their Word.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Retz</hi> died, while the King was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the War of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> so that now there were two vacant Places, which the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> had a great desire to fill, one in the Sacred College, and the other in the King's Council. He enjoy'd them both soon after, particularly his Cardinal's Cap, which <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> XV. promis'd him at the first Promotion he made, when he saw the King desir'd it in good earnest. The instances which <hi>Sillery</hi> made to obtain it, were so much the more vigorous, because being Unkle to <hi>Puysieux,</hi> who was no Friend of the Bishop, he was afraid that if he fail'd to obtain this Cap, it would be said that he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited it but faintly, with an intention to be refused. In short, on the 5th. of <hi>September</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Luçon</hi> was created Cardinal, with the Nuncio of <hi>Poland</hi> of the House of <hi>Torres, Ridolfi</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> and <hi>de la Cueva</hi> a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The King receiv'd the news of this Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and writ a Billet to Cardinal <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visio</hi> to thank him for it. The Bishop was then at <hi>Lyons;</hi> and soon after came to <hi>Avignon,</hi> to give him thanks there in person for the great. Honour he had done him, after he had perform'd the same before in a Letter. The Court came at last to <hi>Lyons;</hi> and here it was that our Prelate, in the Archbishop's Chappel, receiv'd his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:187699:50"/> Cardinal's Cap from the King's Hand, to whom he made a Compliment in the presence of the whole Court. He particularly thanked the Queen-Mother, and made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of being everlastingly her most devoted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; though his everlasting Gratitude and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements coutinu'd no longer, than the Friendship of that Princess was advantageous to him. After this, she did all that lay in her power to procure his re-admission into the Council-Chamber; but she was not able to effect it, till about twenty Months after his Elevation to the Dignity of Cardinal. During this time, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal not only made his Court to her with the same assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity as before; but still discharged the Office of Steward of her House.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:187699:51"/> and seldom or never penetrated into the Motives which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1623"/> set them on, when they accused any one before him. He would listen to all that was told him, especially if it were about a Money-Concern, being extreamly parsimonious, and even covetous towards those whom he was not afraid of. He relied so strangely upon those that had once got an Ascendant over his Mind, that he entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon their Counsel, till such time as some one or other made him entertain an ill Opinion of them. He had been told that <hi>Schomberg</hi> did not understand the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Finances; that he was negligent, and suffered the Treasurers to cheat him, without ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to an account; so that he design'd to turn him out of his Place, and only suspended the execution of it, out of respect to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who appear'd vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously in his behalf. When the Prince was gone for <hi>Italy,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de la Vieville</hi> came to inform his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that <hi>Schomberg</hi> had already spent the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue for the following Year; and that his Father-in-Law <hi>Beaumarchais,</hi> who was Treasurer of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, being unable to exercise his Office that Year with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ruining himself, had intreated his Majesty to give him his Discharge. This last Blow had like to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Reputation with him for ever; the King imagining that all was certainly true, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> had not turn'd it aside for some time, by suggesting a thing to the King, which ought to have come into his Head without any one's Advice, That it was but convenient to know whether what they accus'd the Count of <hi>Schomberg</hi> of was really true, and to hear his Justification.</p>
               <p>This Advice was too just to be absolutely neglected: But although <hi>Schomberg</hi> had declar'd, that he was ready to convince the King of the contrary, yet <hi>Beaumarchais</hi> having said since that, That several Millions must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to defray the King's Expences; and that it would not be possible for him to do it, unless there was another Superintendant, who would give him security for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbursement of the Money; the King then resolved to turn <hi>Schomberg</hi> out of this Place. <hi>Vieville</hi> begg'd it for himself, upon condition that if within two or three Months at farthest, he did not acquit himself in it to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:187699:51"/> Satisfaction, they should put another in his room; and as he was supported by the Chancellor, and <hi>de Puy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieux,</hi> he soon obtain'd it.</p>
               <p>At first this new Superintendant was not admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cabinet-Council, and took all imaginable care to acquire the Esteem of the People: But as soon as he was admitted into the Council, not being able to endure a longer Dependance upon the Chancellor, he began to cabal against him and his Son, and was not unsuccessful in his Designs, as it appear'd in the beginning of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Year.</p>
               <p>All this while Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> acted for the Queen-Mother, in all occasions she was pleas'd to employ him. After the death of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving discovered that he had Money in the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> at the Solicitation of the Duke of <hi>Luines,</hi> he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all his Interest to call it out from thence; but <hi>Cosmo</hi> the Great Duke, to whom the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was indebted, had kept back Two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns of it, under I don't know what Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. This Prince dying in the Year 1621. new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances were made as from the King, to demand this Money of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Successor. At last the King declar'd, that it did not belong to him, but to the Queen his Mother, who began to stickle for it very earnestly, designing to restore it to <hi>Arrigo Concini,</hi> Son to the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre.</hi> Upon this occasion, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had several Conferences with <hi>Condi,</hi> Agent to the Great Duke; and 'twas agreed between them, That the Grand Duke should immediately give the Queen-Mother a Hundred thousand Crowns, and that the King should pay the rest at several Payments, to discharge what he ow'd to the House of <hi>Medicis.</hi> While this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation was on foot, the Grand Duke's Agent offer'd to give Fifty thousand Crowns to the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre</hi>'s Son: But the Cardinal answer'd, That the Queen would never consent to have it publish'd, that she had given the King Two hundred thousand Crowns; which she now design'd to restore to <hi>Concini,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it might offend his Majesty; but that she would have it own'd that this Money belong'd to her self. Thus the Cardinal, either out of Gratitude, or else out of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:187699:52"/> Obedience to the Queen, was serviceable in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Son of his First Benefactor.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the Year 1623. the King talk'd of taking away the Seals from the Chancellour <hi>de Sillery,</hi> under a pretence that being Fourscore Years old, and incommoded with the Gout, he was not able to follow the King in his Voyages. It unluckily happen'd at the same time, that the Marquis <hi>de Puysieux</hi> his Son fell sick of a Quartan Ague, which hinder'd him from being so often about the King as formerly, and put him out of a condition to ward those Blows which were given him in his absence. While he kept his bed, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was detain'd at home by reason of his extream old Age, <hi>la Vieville</hi> manag'd his Game so well, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with the King to discard them both. He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated himself into this Prince's Affection, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his Majesty's Conduct, who marched in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with his Army; whereas the Chancellour disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd these Voyages; and by taking this liberty, had rendred himself disagreeable to the King. This, and other ill Offices which were done him, made his Majesty so resolutely bent to dismiss him, that all the Favour the Chancellour could obtain, was, that in consideration of his old Age, it should appear that he threw it up of his own accord.</p>
               <p>Thus going to wish the King a happy New Year▪ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to bestow the Seals upon one that was neither an Enemy to himself, nor to his Son; and they were given to <hi>d' Aligre,</hi> after <hi>Puysieux</hi> had surrender'd them; which he did on the 2d. of <hi>January.</hi> From that instant the Secretary began to be less assiduous at Court, which he never used to do before. Six days together his Majesty gave Audience to several Ambassadours by himself, without having the Secretary for foreign. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs about him, as the custom is: However, the King look'd pleasingly enough upon him, although he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to cashier him as well as his Father.</p>
               <p>The principal Enemies he had at Court were the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:187699:52"/> Queen-Mother, the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Thoiras,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and several others, who could not endure the great Authority and State he took upon him. The Queen-Mother was offended to see a Minister more powerful than her self near his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; and besides, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> incens'd her against him, because he had as much as in him lay oppos'd his Promotion. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> did not love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had contributed to the Conclusion of a Peace with the <hi>Hugonots</hi> at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> by which he lost the Power he had in the King's Army while the War lasted. The Count <hi>de Soissons</hi> hated him, because for several Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences he had retarded his Marriage with Madam the King's Sister. <hi>Thoiras</hi> was provoked against him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Puysieux</hi> had endeavour'd all manner of ways to turn him out of the King's Favour. And lastly, the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> was his Enemy, because he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the laying down of his Office, which he was min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to leave in favour of one of his Relations. All of them alledg'd a very plausible reason to the King, which was, That it was by no means safe for his Majesty to employ a Man in his Service, who would always think himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, because the Seals were taken away fromhis Father.</p>
               <p>At last, on the 4th. of <hi>February,</hi> the King discharged him as well as the Chancellor, in this manner: He sent a Secretary of the Cabinet to them, with a Billet under his hand, that they might have no pretence to question the Order which he brought them by word of mouth. The Secretary told them, That his Majesty being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they had acquitted themselves but ill in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Places, would make use of them no longet: That they were commanded to retire to one of their Houses out of <hi>Paris:</hi> That nevertheless the King, who never refused Justice to any of his Subjects, gave them full leave to justifie themselves, if they were able, from an infinite number of Accusations; but it must be done at some distance from the Court: And, That they were to receive this as a Recompence for the long Services their Family had done the Crown, and as a most particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, since the King had enough in his hands to proceed against them with much more rigour and severity. The Chancellor receiv'd these Orders, as old Men are wont to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:187699:53"/> do, he complain'd very much of his Misfortune; and said, that in regard of his Justification, he would obey. His Son answer'd with more Courage and Resolution, That their Enemies could advance nothing but downright Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies against them; and that he hop'd to make it appear so, since his Majesty had granted him the favour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himself: That as for the rest, he would not fail to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the King, as he had always done. Immediately after, they order'd the Gates of their House to be shut, <hi>Puysieux</hi> went the same day out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Chancellor the next morning. 'Twas the general Opinion, That as the Son sign'd the King's Orders, and the Father was Master of the Seals, they had employ'd them to their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate advantage. <hi>Puysieux</hi> was accus'd in particular for dispatching Orders to the Ambassadours abroad, of his own head, without acquainting the King with them; nay, that he had frequently made Alterations in those his Majesty had given him. But after a mighty noise and bustle, there were but very few Depositions against them, and even those came from their profess'd Enemies. <hi>Puysieux</hi>'s Place, which related to the War, and to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Affairs, was divided between four Secretaries, who were to give an account of their Administration to the Cabinet-Council, where the Marquis <hi>de la Vieville</hi> had the greatest sway.</p>
               <p>To compleat the ruin of the House of the <hi>Silleries,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remain'd but to re-call the <hi>Commandeur de Sille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who was Ambassadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> which they contriv'd after this manner: To colour his Calling home with some plausible Pretence, since there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <head type="sub">Containing the Principal Transactions under his Ministry, from his Admission into the Council, to the taking of <hi>Rochelle</hi> in 1628.</head>
               <p>THE Court, and the Affairs of the Crown, were in this Posture as I have related, when at last the Queen-Mother prevail'd with the King, that the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> should be receiv'd into the Council of State. At that time there was scarce any Person of great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, or sufficient Capacity at Court to manage the difficult Affairs, which the Crown was like to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in; so that the Cardinal, who possess'd these Qualities in an eminent Degree, was look'd upon as a Man necessary to the State, and who might render it great Services.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:187699:55"/>
               <p> The Court was at <hi>Compiegne;</hi> and the King on the 25th of <hi>April</hi> in the Morning, being in the Queen's Chamber, where he was accustom'd to go every Day at the same Hour, to consult with her about the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs, declar'd the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor of State, to the Queen's great Satisfaction. All the Kingdom took it now for granted, that the King was perfectly reconcil'd to her, and that she had conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably augmented her Authority by introducing her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Minister into the King's Council. In the mean time, those who were of the Council before, and could not behold without Grief, the advancement of the Cardinal, and who fear'd, with reason, lest he should raise himself above them, because of his Dignity, order'd things so, that the King declar'd, he only intended that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late should give his Advice in matters which should be propos'd there, but not to act in Affairs of State, as the King's Minister. His Dignity of Cardinal gave him a Seat over-against the Cardinal of <hi>Rochefoucaud,</hi> above that of the Constable; whereas, when he was Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of State, the other Secretaries thought it hard to give him the Precedence. Although he was extreamly ambitious of the Honour to be admitted into the Council, <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Siri Mem.

                     </gap>.</note> yet he said to those who came to wish him Joy, That the King, purely of his own Motion, had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the way, and had order'd him to obey him; but as for himself, he had rather have liv'd in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

He added, That since the King was resolv'd to load him with so honourable, but heavy a Burden, he had told his Majesty, That, because of his want of Health, he would only attend at Council as often as that would permit him, to give his Opinion when it was asked; but as to negotiate at his own House, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way whatsoever, he had absolutely refus'd, that he might not find Vexation and Trouble, where he only sought his Privacy and Rest; and that the King had exempted him from that Fatigue. But those who knew that he was not so sickly as he pretended, and who were acquainted with his stirring Humour, and greediness of Command, saw easily, that this was only a Copy of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:187699:55"/> his Countenance; and those few people who suffer'd themselves to be cheated by his first Discourses, were in a little time disabus'd.</p>

                  <hi>Paris,</hi> to treat of a Marriage between the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> the King's Sister, and to offer to enter into League with <hi>France</hi> against <hi>Spain.</hi> They desired a joynt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about these two Affairs, and to examine their Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Commissioners were appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> the Keeper of the Seals, the Marquis <hi>de la Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and <hi>la Ville aux-clers.</hi> The Ambassadors not knowing after what manner the Cardinal would receive them, desir'd him to inform them: He answer'd, That he would treat them as he treated the Ambassadors of the Emperor, and the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> That he could not give them the Right Hand, because he gave it not to those Ambassadors; but in conducting them back, he would go further than he had been accustom'd, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he might be suffer'd to cover this Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a pretext, which might hinder others from drawing it into a Precedent. The Ambassadors disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of the Expedient, but begg'd of him to give them time to receive Orders concerning it from the King their Master, and not to take it ill, if whilst they stayed for them, they did not appear in the Queen's Chamber. They added nevertheless, That if he would feign himself to be sick, they would give him a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, and that this would take away all Difficulties.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal kept his Bed on the morrow, and the other Three Commissioners being come to his Chamber, the Ambassadors enter'd soon after, and explain'd the Intention of King <hi>James,</hi> and of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> concerning the Marriage, and the League against <hi>Spain.</hi> Although they desir'd that these two Articles might be conjoin'd, they consented to begin with the first; upon which they represented, That the Proposition which they made of a Marriage between the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and a Daughter of <hi>France</hi> was no new thing, since it had been discours'd of many Years ago, to marry the same Prince with Madam <hi>Christina,</hi> who was afterwards married to the Prince of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> so that they had
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:187699:56"/> nothing to do but to reassume the Articles which were already made, and to continue on the same Foot. The <hi>French</hi> answer'd, That the Face of Affairs was chang'd since that time, and that they had at present other Thoughts; That it was the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Interest to preserve the Reputation of the King in this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age between his Son and his Majesty's Sister; That they could not be contented now with what his <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Majesty had formerly agreed to Madam <hi>Christina</hi> about Religion, after what had happen'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> when there was a Treaty of Marriage between the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and the Infanta. They spoke much about this; and the Ambassadors being press'd to give in writing, what they could agree to, presented an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, by which their Master promis'd free Exercise of the Catholick Religion to Madam and her Train. But the King's Commissioners said, It was necessary to begin, by laying the Eleven Articles on the Table, which his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had agreed with <hi>Spain,</hi> when the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> sought the Infanta. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors immediately rejected this Proposition: To which <hi>De la Ville aux-clers</hi> answer'd, That he was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd that they were not come with Power to make the same Concessions to the <hi>Most Christian King,</hi> which their King had granted to his <hi>Catholick Majesty,</hi> since they might easily know, that <hi>France</hi> would not suffer any ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in this Affair.</p>
               <p>Hereupon a Courier was dispatch'd to the Count <hi>de Teilleres</hi> Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that he should see the Prince and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to them, that the King could demand no less; and how much it imported the Crown of <hi>England</hi> that this Negotiation should not be broken off; that they knew for certain, that the Prince still hearkned to those Propositions which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made him, and which, in all appearance, would turn to his great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. But the King having discover'd, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of <hi>England</hi> had not written to their Master, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Courier was sent to <hi>Teillieres,</hi> to advertise him to take no notice of it. In effect, the Ambassadors of <hi>England</hi> soon consented to agree to all the Articles with <hi>Spain,</hi> except Three; of which, one was concerning

                  </gap> to do to manage the first, whose Favour, bowever, it was not difficult for the King to obtain, if he pleas'd. So the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadors would never consent to grant a Church to the Catholicks, for fear lest the People of <hi>London</hi> should mutiny; although they agreed to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle concerning the Education of the Children. The Court of <hi>France</hi> insisted to have a Bishop sent with the Queen; which the Ambassadors rejected as useless. As to what respected the Dowry, they demanded Eight hundred thousand Crowns; of which half to be paid in <hi>London</hi> the Evening before the Marriage, Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand a Year after, and the rest in six Months after that. They provided also, that if Madam should happen to die before the Prince, without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Prince should be oblig'd to restore only the Moiety.</p>
               <p>This Negotiation being brought thus far, the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors declar'd, that they could proceed no farther; and they sent to <hi>London</hi> what was already agreed to. In the mean time the King of <hi>France</hi> was to procure a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Pope, who was <hi>Ʋrban</hi> the Eighth, for his Sister, that she might be permitted to espouse an Heretick Prince. Three Months slipp'd away in staying for the Pope's Dispensation. The Nuncio <hi>Spada</hi> was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this occasion to represent to the Queen-Mother, that she could not conclude the Marriage of her daughter, without first obtaining License of the Pope; but the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:187699:57"/> Ambassadors of <hi>England</hi> refus'd to stay for it. They apprehended at <hi>Rome,</hi> that this Alliance would engage <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. to support the Interests of the Elector <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine,</hi> a <hi>Calvinist,</hi> Brother-in-Law to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and to cause the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and conferr'd on the Catholick Branch of the House of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to be restor'd to him: But at the bottom <hi>England</hi> did not interest it self much in this; and <hi>France</hi> had never done it, if other things had not happen'd afterwards. Nevertheless, the Pope fearing that this Crown would insensibly oblige it self to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Hereticks, wrote a Brief to the King, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Queen-Mother, by which he endeavour'd to divert them from it. The Nuncio, when he presented them, back'd them with all the Reasons of Reputation and Conscience that he could think off: He told them of the noise that was made of the King's joyning with Hereticks, which brought great Prejudice to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion in general; and more especially in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Siri Rec.</hi> p. 614.</note> The King answer'd, That the Pope should find him no less a good Catholick than the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> and that this perhaps was the only Reason that retarded the Marriage of his Sister. The Queen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, amongst other things, said, That the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who hindred the Marriage, and rais'd so many Scruples, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd at present a Blank to the King of <hi>England;</hi> but that her Daughter should not depart till they had taken all Assurances which could be requir'd on the account of Religion. As for the League which the <hi>English</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, it was said, That it was not concluded for that; and that the Marriage was to precede, as a thing which had no relation to the other.</p>
               <p>It was believ'd that the Queen-Mother long'd pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately for this Marriage, to secure her self of a new Support, in case any disturbances should arise in <hi>France.</hi> The Nuncio was not contented with speaking to her before Matters were concluded with the <hi>English;</hi> he spoke also to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to whom he represented, that his Character, and his Dignity, oblig'd him to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the conclusion of the Marriage, without the Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Holiness; and that if people saw he oppos'd it but coldly, the Laick Counsellors of State would easily give their Hands to it.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:187699:57"/>
               <p> The principal Difficulty they insisted upon at <hi>Rome,</hi> and which the <hi>French</hi> could hardly resolve, was, that the Pope could not with Honour agree to a Dispensation, in favour of a Marriage between the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> on Conditions less advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the Catholick Religion, than those which had been made with the Insanta of <hi>Spain:</hi> It would be more honourable for <hi>France</hi> to come to a Conclusion on better Terms than the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> said truly, That the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> had agreed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> what they had demanded; but that then he was in their hands, and that as soon as he was departed from <hi>Spain,</hi> he revok'd all. But to this it was replied, That since the Prince was willing to marry so great a Princess as the Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> he must needs come up to their Proposals, because he could not well renew with <hi>Spain.</hi> But as it was impossible to obtain from the Parliament a Church for the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> saw very well, that the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> would rather quit his Pretensions to the King's Sister, than agree to a thing which he could not grant without hazarding all: So that they were resolved to pass over this Article.

The mischief is,</hi> answered the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, <hi>that we are not now in a condition to have any regard to what may be done with Honour. Spada</hi> replied, That the <hi>French</hi> could not possibly avoid the Censure of the World; and the rather, because the <hi>English</hi> boasted they had already gain'd the Point they desir'd, as well relating to the Marriage it self, as to the Circumstances of it. He meant the Pretensions of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, that they had out-witted the Cardinal. But the Cardinal said, That he never went to meet them, nor did he accompany them, but only staid for them in the Chamber of the Assembly, sitting in the most honourable Place, or standing, until the Table was brought in: That he was the First who spake, and the First who seated himself; and that he never rendred them a Visit, for which the Earl of <hi>Carlisle</hi> was very angry.</p>
               <p>Some time before this Conversation, Father <hi>Berulle</hi> was sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to press on the Dispensation: He had <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Siri, Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 5. p. 623.</note> Instructions given him, dated the 31st. of <hi>July,</hi> which contain'd amongst other things, That this Marriage might be of great advantage to the Catholick Religion, because the Princess being well brought up, and firm in her Faith, might gain the Prince her Spouse, and put the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks in security, in respect of their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:187699:58"/> Estates and Lives: That the King of <hi>England</hi> being by that means fix'd to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> would no more foment the Hatred which the Protestants had against the Catholicks; so that the <hi>Turks</hi> seeing the Unity of the Christians, would dare to attempt nothing against them: That his most Christian Majesty had declar'd to the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadours, that he would do nothing that might derogate from the Respect due to his Holiness: That it was agreed, that the Ceremony of the Espousals should be perform'd according to the Usage of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the same was practis'd at the Marriage of <hi>Margarette de Valois,</hi> and the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre:</hi> That it was moreover agreed, that she should have the free Exercise of the Catholick Religion for her self and Family; so that in the Royal Houses where she should reside, there should be a Chappel for hearing of Mass, and administring the Sacraments: That she should have a Bishop for her Grand Almoner, with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient power to proceed against the Ecclesiasticks who neglected their Duty: That there should be of them to the number of Twenty six, who when they officiated, should wear their Ecclesiastical Habits: That the King and the Prince should swear never to urge the Princess nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly nor indirectly, to do any thing whatsoever contrary to the Catholick Religion: That her Domesticks should be <hi>French</hi> Catholicks, chosen by the most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King; and when any died, they should substitute others of the same Religion in their places: That the Children born in this Marriage, should be brought up by their Mother until they arrived to the Age of Thirteen Years: That the King of <hi>England,</hi> in consideration of this Alliance, should hinder all molestation of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Subjects; and that they should be compelled to take no Oath contrary to their Religion. It was on this foot that they demanded the Dispensation.</p>
               <p>But because the Pope might object, That the Articles with <hi>Spain</hi> were more advantageous to the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than those of <hi>France,</hi> they charged Father <hi>Berulle</hi> to represent to him, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to gain time, and not to surrender the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> offered at present to be contented with less than the King of <hi>England</hi> had agreed to his Majesty; and that the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to draw
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:187699:59"/> himself out of the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had promised more than he had design'd to make good: That, in fine, it was impossible to obtain more from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Father <hi>Berulle</hi> acquitted himself of his Commission so well, that the Pope was mollified, and promis'd the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, which he afterwards sent; whether he was afraid, that if he should refuse it obstinately, they would slight it; or else that he was convinc'd with the Reasons had been given him. There was yet in <hi>England</hi> some difficulty on the Articles which <hi>France</hi> suppos'd she might obtain, and upon which the Dispensation was grounded. But, in fine, the King of <hi>England</hi> consented to what was desired, and the Articles were sign'd the 20th. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1624. by the Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu</hi> and the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours. The King sent <hi>la Villeaux Clers</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to take of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Oaths which we have mention'd: They took them between his hands, and further swore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease all the Catholick Prisoners, as soon as the Marriage was consummated; and to prohibit for the future their being ill treated for their Religion.

He took so much care in the Education of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that that Prince, in a very little time, made a very great progress in all things which can be requir'd in a Person of his Quality: His Wit was admir'd, his Discourse, and the obliging manner, with which he receiv'd all Persons who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed themselves to him. But as Courtiers, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally abardon themselves to Vices, dread the Vertues of Princes, which they find opposite to their Designs, <hi>De Breves</hi> soon had the Grief to be remov'd from the Person of Monsieur, at the time when he was most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to him. He is told he must retire, a little after the Death of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> in 1617. and to get such an Order from the King, they had taken care to make him jealous of the good Qualities of his Brother, who, some Persons affirmed, had more Wit, and better Education than he. In the interim, in a Council which was held at the Chancellor <hi>Sillery</hi>'s, where were present <hi>du Vair, Villeroy,</hi> and the President <hi>Jeannin,</hi> it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:187699:60"/> was concluded to find another Governour for Monsieur: They call'd <hi>De Breves</hi> before them; and after they had given him abundance of Praises, for the great care he had taken in the Education of that Prince, they told him, That his Majesty would have him take no further pains, without giving him any manner of reason. The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor added, That he had Orders from the King to tell him, that he was perfectly satisfied with him; and for a proof of it, his Majesty made him a present of Fifty thousand Crowns, to be paid in three Years out of the Treasury, and gave him a Warrant for Six thousand Livres Pension. <hi>Luines,</hi> willing to assure himself of the Person of Monsieur, gave him the Count <hi>de Lude</hi> for Governour, who had been his own Domestick. This new Governour had, in a little time, rooted out all the Seeds of Vertue, which <hi>de Breves</hi> had endeavour'd to sow in the Mind of the Prince; and being addicted to Pleasure, left the care of the Prince's Education to his Sub-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whose gross and brutish Manners entirely corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed young <hi>Gaston,</hi> who so accustom'd himself to Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under this Man, that he never could leave off that ill habit. The Count <hi>de Lude</hi> dying about the end of the Year 1619. they made <hi>Ornane,</hi> Colonel of the Guards of <hi>Corsi,</hi> and the King's Lieutenant-General in <hi>Normandy,</hi> Governour to Monsieur: He was a Man of great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and did all he could to cure him of the ill habits which the Prince, drown'd in Voluptuousness, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and had no ill success, which seem'd now to be of the greatest importance; the King then having no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it might happen that <hi>Gaston</hi> should succeed to the Crown. In the sequel, <hi>Ornano</hi> suggested to him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King to be admitted into the Privy-Council, that he might enter there himself by the favour of his Master. To gain the better on his Spirit, he began to be more indulgent to him, and to have a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance for him. The Marquis <hi>de la Vieville,</hi> though in in the Declination of Favour, perceiving the Designs of the Colonel, work'd so with the King, that he was apprehended, and sent Prisoner to <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> whatever <hi>Gaston</hi> could do to obtain his liberty. At the same time his Majesty ordain'd <hi>Despreaux</hi> to be his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who had been his own Sub-Governour whilst
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:187699:61"/> he was Dauphin, and depended wholly on his Majesty: But this was but for a small time; for after the Marquis <hi>de Vieville</hi>'s disgrace, the King, induced by the Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Monsieur, gave <hi>Ornano</hi> his liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his old Post. All the fault of his Imprisonment was thrown on the disgraced Minister, as if the King, who had given the Orders for his Arrest, had had no hand in it.</p>

It was said, That <hi>Tillieres</hi> was not fit for that Court, because he was too much a Friend to the Jesuits, who were hated in <hi>England;</hi> but the principal reason was, a Letter which he had written to the King; by which he gave him notice, that the Queen his Mother, without his knowledge, was treating in <hi>England,</hi> about the Marriage of Madam, by Persons intermediate; which so provok'd the Queen-Mother, that she destroy'd his Reputation with the King. <hi>D'Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at</hi> arriv'd at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>July;</hi> and his principal Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was, to discover if King <hi>James</hi> had really left off dealing with <hi>Spain,</hi> and meant the Marriage of his Son with Madam sincerely; for it was still doubted in <hi>France.</hi> His Instructions gave him the Title of Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador in Ordinary; but they afterwards gave him that of Extraordinary.

But at his going out the Marquis was apprehended by the Count <hi>de Thermes,</hi> Captain of the Guards, and the King's Musqueteers carried him in a Coach to the Castle of <hi>Amboise;</hi> out of which place he afterwards made his escape.</p>
               <p>The Reasons of his Disgrace, such I mean as were publish'd, were, that he took too much Authority upon him; and that of his own Head he had determin'd Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the greatest Importance; That he had sent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on the same account to the King's Ambassadors, and given Answers to those of other Princes, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the King or his other Ministers; That he had chang'd the Orders given in the King's Presence, and charg'd the King of many Injustices, which himself had been guilty of to satisfie his own Passions: <hi>Beaumarchez</hi> his Father-in-Law, and Treasurer of the Exchequer, was suspended from his Office, and consined to one of his Houses.</p>
               <p>The King afterwards gave Commission for their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and it was hop'd they might draw in the good Man, <hi>Beaumarchez,</hi> who was very rich. But the Mareschal <hi>de Vitry,</hi> his other Son-in-Law, obtain'd that his Name might be taken out of the Commission, and that only <hi>La Vieville</hi> and his Accomplices should be named. It was pretended, that it could be made out that he had cheated the King, because he had bought, since he was Superintendant, Lands worth Fourteen thousand Livres in Rent: But it was not difficult to prove, that he might make this Purchase out of his own Lands, and the Sale of some Offices which he had. He was accus'd to have given eight hundred thousand Livres to his Father-in-Law: But <hi>Beaumarchez</hi> made it appear, that he had lent them to the King, after his Son became Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant. Whatsoever they could do, they could not find any misapplications in the Treasury, to charge him with.</p>

               <p> It was reported, that while he was in favour he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to secure himself of the Support of the Queen-Mother, and become her Favourite as well as the King's; and seeing that the Cardinal enjoy'd that place with the Queen which he desired, he had the boldness to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to that Princess, that she might be absolute Master of the King and all the Court if she would rid her self of the Cardinal; who not being belov'd by the King, was the reason why he did not place an entire Confidence in her. He offer'd to serve the Queen as well as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal could do: But she perceived it was more for his envying that she kept this Prelate in her Service than to augment her Authority. This was the beginning of his Ruin, which was daily endeavour'd, when it was found that he design'd to rule solely in the King's Favour and his Mother's. It happened that some of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers spoke much in praise of the Cardinal, in report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King at his going to Bed, and when he was hunting, many things which this Prelate had done or said for his Service; of which a great part were Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>La Vieville,</hi> who perceiv'd this Design of those who made use of this Artifice, said one day to the King, That the Cardinal indeed was a Person of great Parts, and very capable to serve his Majesty; but withal, so imperious and haughty, that if he should put the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Affairs into his Hands, he must ask him leave to go a hunting. This pass'd before the Cardinal was receiv'd into the Council; and <hi>la Vieville</hi> was so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent as to assist to raise this Prelate to that Post, in a time when the manner of his exercising the Charge of Superintendent, had rendered him odious to a great many People, whose Pensions he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd.</p>
               <p>The King caus'd the King of <hi>England</hi> to be advertis'd of the Disgrace of the Superintendent; which gave no small Alarm at that Court, because it was believ'd, that since he, who had first negotiated the Affair of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was disgrac'd, it was a sign that <hi>France</hi> would break the Match. There were, besides, some other Circumstances which confirmed his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in this Opinion; which was, That they would not approve of the Articles of the Marriage, as they had
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:187699:62"/> been order'd by <hi>Carlisle</hi> and <hi>Vieville.</hi> This later having said, That they demanded an Article in favour of the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks merely for Form, the Ambassadors omitted it; and <hi>Vieville</hi> having passed it over, without telling any Person, the King and the other Ministers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to approve of this Retrenchment, and said, That <hi>Vieville</hi> had releas'd this Article without Order. The King of <hi>England</hi> presently look'd upon this as a Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and for a Sign that they would break the Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but having after found the contrary, he renew'd it, and agreed to all, as we have already said.</p>
               <p>To come now to the Affair of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> the Reader must be inform'd, that in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had endeavour'd to obtain a free Passage from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> for the reciprocal Communication of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> For this they had built in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> the Fort of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> that the <hi>Grisons</hi> to whom the <hi>Valteline</hi> belong'd, might not be capable to dispute their Passage when need requir'd. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> were very much alarm'd on this occasion, fearing that the House of <hi>Austria</hi> was just on the point to execute some considerable Enterprize. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> declar'd, That they had built this Fort only to protect the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which they said was there oppress'd by the <hi>Grison</hi> Protestants. It was soon after made visible, that this Discourse was only to lull the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> asleep, since they built four other Forts; and having rais'd the Catholick <hi>Grisons,</hi> made themselves absolute Masters of all the Valley. Then the Council of <hi>France</hi> believ'd that it was time to look about them in good earnest, having yet employ'd only the way of Treaties and Negotiations, wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> promis'd what they desir'd, but perform'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They had long Conferences with the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Holy See was taken up many Years to reconcile the two Crowns: But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were resolv'd at any rate to preserve the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage which they had open'd; and the <hi>French</hi> were no less obstinate to hinder the Communication of the Estates of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> by which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came too formidable both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and there was no way left to procure an Agreement. Upon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:187699:63"/> this a League was made between the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savey,</hi> concluded at <hi>Paris</hi> the 7th of <hi>February,</hi> 1623. by which these three Powers oblig'd themselves to set on Foot (until the <hi>Valteline</hi> was wholly recover'd) an Army of Thirty six thousand Foot, and Six thousand Horse. This League put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into such a fright, that they thought it their best way to deposite the Forts of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> in the Hands of the Pope. By this Artifice they rendred the League abovemention'd useless, they avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the War with which they were threatned, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd his Holiness to their Party, and more easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded him, that their Zeal for the Catholick Religion had engag'd them to build the Forts then in dispute. In the mean time they had the Passage open as they had desir'd, and hoped to withdraw those Forts out of the Hands of the Pope, as soon as the League made against them should be dissolv'd. Many things interven'd while this Affair was on foot, which I shall pass by; 'tis suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to observe, that the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Ministry, found it in this Posture.</p>
               <p>As for him, he judg'd it requisite, that the King should do himself reason by the way of force, since the prolonging of Treaties made whatsoever was done ineffectual. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 5. p. 635.</note> He did not hide his Sentiments from the Nuncio; to whom he said one Day, That the King and Council now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to see this Affair ended in a few Months; and that the Council would act more steadily, since it had a Head now that was not inconstant like the former. In effect, the Marquis of <hi>Coeuvres</hi> was sent into <hi>Switzerland</hi> in Quality of Ambassador Extraordinary, with <note n="*" place="margin">In the Month of <hi>Jane.</hi>
                  </note> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which directed him, that if this Affair was not suddenly accommodated, to raise Three thousand <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and Three thousand <hi>Swissers,</hi> and to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent upon the <hi>Valteline.</hi> The Forces of the League were also to be ready to march by the 15th of <hi>September,</hi> to act before Winter. The Confederate Princes had many Reasons to make hast, since without that, the <hi>Swissers</hi> and the <hi>Grisons,</hi> who expected to be presently deliver'd from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Yoak, would grow cold when they found too much delay; and that the Arch-Duke <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> would not sail in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:187699:63"/> the Winter to seize on all the Passages, and fortifie them well; so that it would be very difficult to force them. In the Interim, as the time was but short, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were given to the Count of <hi>Bethunes,</hi> to press the Pope and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> strongly, and to use some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Remonstrances, and sometimes Threats, to make the last to desist from maintaining the Passages of the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these instances signified nothing; and the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> had Orders to hasten his Levies, and get all things ready for execution. The Levies being made, a difficulty presented it self, which embarrass'd him for some time, which was, whether he should demand Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage at the Diet of <hi>Baden.</hi> For although by the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Swissers</hi> with the Crown, they were oblig'd to give him free Passage, it was to be fear'd lest the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio and the Ambassador of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom the Catholick Cantons favour'd, should prevail with them to oppose it, and that this refusal might spoil the Design. In fine, he resolv'd not to demand it of the Catholicks, but when he took it, and to speak then only to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, who would agree to it, only on condition that the King should assist them as occasion should require. The Nuncio and the Ambassador of <hi>Spain</hi> forgot not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Artifice to stop the design of <hi>Coeuvres;</hi> and to gain time, gave him hopes, that the Affair might be agreed at <hi>Rome.</hi> But he proceeded with the same vigour as before, and fix'd the rising, as it was agreed with the <hi>Grisons,</hi> on the 26th of <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time the Nuncio <hi>Spada</hi>

The King answer'd, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> forc'd him to it, and that it should appear in all his Conduct, that he was as good a Catholick as they.

The
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:187699:64"/> Nuncio reply'd, in the way of Raillery, that he and the Cardinal <hi>de Rochefoucaud</hi> could not but be much puzzled in the Council, when they deliberated about such Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, since they must at the same time fight with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and yet avoid falling into such an irregularity, as it was to be a favourer of Hereticks; which was a thing ill of it self, and therefore could not obtain a Dispensation. The Cardinal answer'd, That there was the same reason to grant him a Dispensation for the Charge of Councellor, as for that of Secretary; and as for what concern'd the Hereticks, the difference of the Case, and the end which was propos'd, chang'd the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things; and in this Affair he believ'd, he did not only the King, but God good Service, since he had stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, as he said, this Question, and found that the Case, as it was represented to the King, was such, that he would maintain, that nothing was done or thought of, which was not agreeable to the strictest Rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and that he would cause this Proposition to be subscrib'd by an hundred Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon.</hi>

They shew'd them to the Pope, and thereupon made a great noise at <hi>Rome,</hi> but took no measures to hinder it: Whether they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that it was nothing but an airy Project only to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them; and that the <hi>French</hi> durst not put it in execution; or that they had not Sense enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that if they did not hasten their Succours, the <hi>Valteline</hi> would be taken from them in spight of the Pope's Garrisons.</p>
               <p>Whilst the <hi>Spaniards</hi> debated about this Affair at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> finish'd his Levies; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Vaubecourt</hi> being enter'd into <hi>Swisserland,</hi> march'd through it, in so much Order and Discipline, that they gave no occasion for Complaint. Being join'd to the new Troops rais'd in the Valley, and on the Lands of the Ecclesiastical Cantons, this little Army took its way to the <hi>Valteline.</hi> In the mean time the Catholick Cantons deliberated at <hi>Lucerne,</hi> whether they should
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:187699:64"/> permit the Passage or no, which without doubt they had refus'd, had the others demanded it, before they were ready, for fear they should draw upon themselves the Troops of the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> But the Army being on their march, the conclusion of all was, to send an Envoy to the King to entreat him, that no more Troops might be sent into their Country, for Reasons they would declare. The Army took its march towards the middle of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> so that it kept in Alarm, <hi>Chiavenne, Bormio, Tirano,</hi> and the Fort <hi>de Valmonastero.</hi> Before it had advanc'd far, the Garrison of this last Fort, which was built in a Valley, and served for a Line of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between <hi>Tiron</hi> and the <hi>Valteline,</hi> abandod▪d it, taking with them the Cannon and the Ammunitions. This Garrison was commanded by an Officer of the Arch-Duke's Troops, who by deserting this Post so cowardly, without staying for the coming up of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which had no Cannon with it, gave opportunity to the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> to sieze it, and entirely to shut up the Passage to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Troops, who could not advance that way. So happy a beginning fill'd the <hi>French</hi> General with Courage; but before he passed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he caused the Passes which he left behind him to be fortified, that he might that way receive the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als which came out of <hi>Swisserland.</hi> Afterwards he went to <hi>Maienfeld,</hi> and sent <hi>Haraucourt,</hi> Mareschal <hi>de Camp,</hi> to draw together the People of the <hi>Eight Rights,</hi> who were ready to throw off the Yoak of the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.</hi> He conven'd a general Assembly of the <hi>Grisons</hi> at <hi>Coire,</hi> where he propos'd four things which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; the first was, the re-union of the three Leagues which had embroil'd themselves, whom he easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to resume their ancient Liberty, and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which they enjoy'd before the last Wars. The second was, to renew the ancient Seats of the Leagues. The third was, a General Pardon, (which was to be granted to those of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> who had taken Arms) and the liberty of Religion. The fourth was, that they should make an Alliance with the King only, excepting the Hereditary Peace with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Alliance which the <hi>Swissers</hi> had with them.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:187699:65"/>

He found there that they had broken the Bridges which open'd to him the way into the midst of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> and having repair'd them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as I said, he had no Cannon, he made a Shew as if he would attack <hi>Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

There are no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who regard Ecclesiasticks less than those who know them to the bottom, as <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> who had been Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador at <hi>Rome</hi> for many Years. Thus he presently reduc'd the Pope's General to surrender <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11.</note> the Castle of <hi>Tirano,</hi> after he had taken the City by Composition.

                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11.</note> whose noise had so alarm'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, that he talk'd of capitulating: The Soldiers, who desir'd the same, presently left the Ramparts; and the <hi>French</hi> siez'd on them so briskly, that before they had come to Articles, the Castle was taken, and the Pope's Soldiers stripp'd. They gave them their Lives; and the <hi>French</hi> General, out of respect to the Pope, sent them back with their Ensigns to <hi>Bagni,</hi> although some of them had thrown themselves there after the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Tirano,</hi> contrary to the Capitulation. The <hi>French,</hi> by the Reduction of <hi>Sondrio,</hi> were in capacity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance as far as the Fort of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> which was at the other end of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> to observe the motion of some
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:187699:65"/>
                  <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops, who lay posted along the Lake of <hi>Côme,</hi> and whereof six Companies were enter'd into <hi>Riva</hi> and <hi>Nova.</hi> But the Weather was too cold, and the Passages of the Mountains were too hard to be forc'd to make a new attempt. Thus the <hi>French</hi> found themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of almost all the <hi>Valteline,</hi> without shedding any Blood of their own or of the Popes Troops. The Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> whose assistance <hi>Bagni</hi> had desir'd, and who ought to have had Troops on the Frontiers, ready to march at the first notice, took no care to send them until it was too late, according to the Custom of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who deliberate when they should be in action; and make a bustle when it is too late to do good. <hi>Bagni,</hi> a Man both without Courage and Experience, with the Troops rais'd in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical State, where no body is advanc'd by Feats of Arms, and where the Profession of War is unknown, found himself uncapable to make the least resistance, and by his retreat made it appear, that he was mistaken in depending on himself or his Soldiers.</p>
               <p>In the interim, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army was on the Frontiers of <hi>Tirol,</hi> to hinder the Arch-Duke from undertaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, and to succour the <hi>French</hi> if occasion requir'd; but many difficulties interven'd, which render'd the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Troops useless on this occasion. It was the same with Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> who was to have brought an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of twenty thousand Men into <hi>Germany,</hi> compos'd principally of <hi>English,</hi> with some Auxiliary Troops of <hi>France</hi> and the United Provinces, to reconquer the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate, or at least to winter on the Lands of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> Neither <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>England</hi> would declare themselves openly against <hi>Spain,</hi> so as to come to a breach with that Crown; although <hi>England</hi> was willing to make a Rupture with the Emperour. There was yet more difficulties for the Passage and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of these Troops; the <hi>French</hi> would not let them pass through their Territories; and the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would not have them cross the <hi>Spanish Netherlands. France</hi> had also made a Project, to send the Constable of <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi> to joyn with a Body of <hi>French</hi> Troops, and some Forces of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to attack the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> to support the Pretensions which the Duke had upon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:187699:66"/>
                  <hi>Zuccarello,</hi> which the <hi>Genouese</hi> kept; and if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1625"/> to take <hi>Genoa</hi> it self. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> would fain have had the <hi>French</hi> to make an open Breach with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to enter into the <hi>Milanese:</hi> But although the Cardinal, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the principal Minister, did think effectually to make War against <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet he thought it not convenient to declare his Design as yet. This was the Action which passed this Year; and the <hi>French</hi> were contented to render themselves Masters of the greatest part of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> without enterprizing any thing else, nothwithstanding the Instances of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.</p>
               <p>Yet in the mean time, the Design of the Cardinal was to make War on the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> whose Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness seem'd to over-shadow <hi>France;</hi> and he made no scruple to say, before those whom he could trust, That to make an assured Peace, <hi>Spain</hi> was to be brought to it, not by Treaties, but by Arms. Were it that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that the good of the State requir'd it or not, it was his particular Interest quickly to do something remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which might be for the Honour of his Ministry, and to take from the <hi>French</hi> the Opinion they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, That when Affairs were in the hands of a Bishop and a Cardinal, the Council must necessarily incline to Peace. The Marquis of <hi>Mirabel,</hi> Ambassadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> understood very well the Designs of this Principal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who treated with the Ambassadours of <hi>England,</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> of the <hi>Ʋnited Provinces,</hi> and of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to induce these Powers to act against the House of <hi>Austria</hi> in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places at the same time; whilst he protested to the Envoy of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the Agent of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and to all those who were concern'd in the Affairs of that House, in <hi>France,</hi> or with its Allies, that the King endeavour'd nothing more than to entertain a Peace with her: That <note n="*" place="margin">About the middle of <hi>Decemb.</hi> See <hi>Siri, Mem.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:187699:66"/> and above all on such occasions which in any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1624"/> manner regarded Religion: That this smelt of a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran:</hi> That for his sake he had patience till then, in hopes the Cardinal would in time moderate himself; but finding that these Designs to assist the Hereticks were ready to be executed, he could no longer keep silence; that he thought himself at last obliged to discharge his Conscience; and the rather, since by being silent, he should injure the Affairs of his Master, in whose Name he protested before GOD, against all the Evil which might happen to Christendom. The Cardinal provoked with this Discourse, answer'd, That he knew very well the difference between an Affair of Religion, and an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of State: That as he was a Priest, Cardinal, and good Catholick, born in <hi>France,</hi> where there are no Mungrels, and moreover, Minister of the most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King, he ought not, nor could not propose to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self any other prospect, than the Conservation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Grandeur, and not the Interests of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which were known to tend to the Universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and to give no Bounds to his Desires: That he would no longer hide his Sentiments thereupon to the Ambassadour of his Catholick Majesty, since, in sine, it was time to take off the Mask. Others give account of this Conversation something differently: Be it as it will, the Marquis <hi>de Mirabel</hi> perceiving that he was too much transported before he went from him, made Excuses to the Cardinal, which caused him to understand, that these Discourses had not been premeditated, but was purely the effect of the Ambassador's Choler.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1625"/> there was no care taken for the razing of <hi>Fort-Lewis,</hi> which was a thousand Paces from <hi>Rechelle,</hi> though they were engag'd to do it by one of the Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Montpellier.</hi> The <hi>Rochellers</hi> got it to be represented to the King several times; but after he had heard their Complaints, there were nothing but fair Words given them. Instead of staying till the King was engaged in a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> as in all appearance he would sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, and pressing him in that Conjuncture, when neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity would have oblig'd him to keep his Word with them, they would needs do themselves Justice <note n="*" place="margin">In the ginning of <hi>January.</hi>
                  </note>: They
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:187699:67"/> therefore gave some Ships to <hi>Soubise,</hi> who went to <hi>Blavet</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1625"/> to surprize seven Vessels of the King's which were in that Port. But as he thought to retire, the Wind chang'd, and gave them hopes that he might be taken himself. The Duke of <hi>Vendôme</hi> run thither, with all the Nobility of <hi>Britany;</hi> but the Wind changing again, disengag'd <hi>Soubise,</hi> who retreated in spight of the Cannon of the Castle. Of seven great Ships, he carried away six, but left one of his own, which had embarass'd herself with the seventh, at the mouth of the Haven, where touching on a Bank, they both stuck fast. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards essay'd to besiege the Fort, which incommoded them; but not having been able to take it readily, they gave over that Enterprize, for fear of drawing the King's Army upon them.

               <p>At the beginning of the Year, the Pope sent <hi>Bernardin Nari,</hi> to complain on his behalf about the Business of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> with the Nuncio <hi>Spada:</hi> They did it with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Exaggerations, as if all had been lost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pope had the <hi>Valteline</hi> no longer in deposite. The King, the Queen-Mother, and some of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters told them, That <hi>Coeuvres</hi> had done more than his Orders would bear; but that they were ready to dispose all things to his Holiness's satisfaction: Which was not true. But the Cardinal answer'd them with more reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>January</hi> 15.</note> laughing at the heat and eagerness which the Nuncio had shown in this Affair. The conclusion of his Speech was, That all that the King could do, was either to deliver the Forts of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to the Pope, on condition that his Holiness should promise, by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or by Word of mouth, That he would, in a short time to be prefixed, demolish them; or to agree a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality to his Holiness; in which case they promised to make him such Propositions as should give him cause to be satisfied. The Ministers of the Pope were satisfied with neither of these Particulars; and the Cardinal told them, That if the Transaction had been solely for the Pope's Interests, the King would not meddle, that he might have reason to be contented with him; but it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:187699:67"/> was a Question which concerned the Interests of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who were ready to triumph at the least advantage they had over the Arms of the King. Upon this, <hi>Spada</hi> and <hi>Nari</hi> said, That they would of necessity reduce the Pope to do things disagreeable to <hi>France,</hi> if there was not satisfaction made him. The Cardinal who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knew the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> replied▪ smiling. He knew very well that the Pope never thought to let things come to extremity; and that if he saw it, he should not believe it: That he knew the contrary: and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ready to remit their Pretensions into the hands of the Pope, and would give him a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Gold, provided he could but deliver them out of their present Perplexities. He added many things to this, to signifie his Aversion to the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> and said, That he hoped in two Years wholly to ruine them: That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entertain'd a secret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them, that they might, by such Artifices, divert <hi>France</hi> from other Designs; but they should never carry things so as to oblige them to make a disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Treaty.</p>
               <p>Many Councils were held on the Complaint of the Pope's Agents, to seek out ways for the Pope's satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, although they were resolved to follow the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Cardinal, who would no way recede from what he had proposed. From this moment▪ this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late was Master of the Resolutions, the King being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to express himself in general terms, and to remit himself as for the rest to his Council, and no body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the Cardinal, supported by the Authority of the Queen-Mother.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:187699:68"/> the Designs of the Court, he found this Prelate in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1624"/> the same Disposition as before. The Cardinal added moreover to what he had said, That if in six Months these <hi>Brouilleries</hi> between the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were not accommodated, all <hi>Europe</hi> would be in a flame; and what was the worst, <hi>Spain</hi> would be all embroil'd; the King would be constrain'd to make Peace with the <hi>Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As for him, he was surpriz'd that <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>i</hi> had no Orders to make any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to reconcile these Differences, and spoke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the restitution of Forts, which were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them. At last, speaking of bringing the War into <hi>Italy</hi> against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> concerning which he had hinted some things in another Conversation with the same Ministers of the Pope, he said, That the King had great Designs on that side, and sufficient Forces to bring things to pass; and that they thought to bestow half the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> on his Holiness. The Nuncio thereupon replied, That <hi>France</hi> might make a Present to the Pope, which would not cost her so dear, and which might perhaps save her a great deal of trouble; and that was, to give his Holiness the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which was then in dispute. <hi>We also will give it,</hi> replied the Cardinal, <hi>provided the Pope assist us in our Designs; otherwise it is not just that we should weaken our Allies, instead of helping them to what of right belongs to them, as we have promised.</hi> The Nuncio answer'd, That <hi>France</hi> wanted not the means to indemnisie them; and that by making this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Pope, she would prevent several Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: That the Cardinal would regain the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they had already conceived of his Piety, and re-establish at the same time the Reputation of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> That the Guard of the Passage of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> could not be given to a Prince that had more Interest for the Repose of <hi>Italy</hi> than the Pope; and that it proceeded from his care to preserve that Repose; which had put the <hi>French</hi> in motion, as they said them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The Cardinal, instead of returning an Answer,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:187699:68"/> took upon him to justifie the Conduct of <hi>France,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1625"/> passed to something else.</p>
               <p>About this time he took one Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> a <hi>Capucin,</hi> to be his Confessor, with a design to employ him more in the Affairs of State, than in what related to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; he began presently to intermeddle, as well as Father <hi>Jacynthe,</hi> who took care of the Affairs of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> The Nuncio seeing it, wrote this Judgment to the Cardinal-Patron: That he might make Father <hi>Joseph</hi> an honest Man; but he was sure at best, that he had a Gift in Negotiation, though he was full of Tricks. He was, as <hi>Spada</hi> judg'd, entirely the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's, and more proper to confirm abroad the Sentiments of this Prelate, than to draw him to his own, and change his Thoughts <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hug. Grot. Ep.</hi> P. I. p. 375. <hi>&amp;</hi> 380.</note>. And the Ambassador of <hi>Sweden</hi> in <hi>France</hi> observ'd in one of his Letters, that the Cardinal made use of this Monk to hammer out Negotiations, and to sweeten the Discontents of those with whom he treated, and to ripen Affairs before this Prelate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd. In this Post that Monk acquitted himself well enough; but observed ill the Rule of his Institution; so that he was reproached, that for the Glory of God, and the Good of the State, he forsook his Convent, and went ordinarily in a Coach. He was very serviceable to the Cardinal, in sending to the Nuncio from him, and bringing back what the Nuncio said. He was farther employ'd to form some Articles concerning the State and Religion of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which were sent to <hi>Rome;</hi> and People talked of sending him thither in a Coach, to treat with his Holiness. But this Project, and many others, were stifled. It was only agreed, with a great deal of difficulty, on the part of <hi>France,</hi> that a suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Arms should be in the <hi>Valteline</hi> for two Months; but this suspension not being concluded till <hi>February,</hi> gave time to <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> on the 17th. of <hi>January,</hi> to take the Fort <hi>Bormio,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Chiavenne</hi> the 9th. of <hi>March,</hi> before he had news of the suspension of Arms. The Council had a design, by this delay, to give time to the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres,</hi> to gain, if it were possible, the rest of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> being perswaded that the more he got, the more advantageous would the Treaty then on foot be. As if it was not known what would be the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:187699:69"/> issue of this Affair, the King gave Orders to <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> to suspend the Advantages he had gotten over the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> to fortifie what he held, and to prepare Materials neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the fortification of what remain'd to be taken, in case, after the suspension, he should happen to become Master of them. Although the Pope's Ministers made tragical Complaints at <hi>Paris;</hi> yet <hi>Ʋrban</hi> VIII. continu'd to treat at the ordinary rate with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; which made it be believ'd, that the Pontiff did not take the Affair of the <hi>Valteline</hi> much to heart. Besides, it was known in <hi>France,</hi> that if they seem'd to fear the Complaints of the Nuncio, they would increase daily; and if one despise them, they cease of themselves. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> always renders it self valuable to those who make too much of it, and participates the fear with those who resist it. It was this which spoil'd the pathetick Remonstrances of <hi>Spada</hi> and <hi>Nari</hi> at the Court of <hi>France.</hi> In the mean time, the Second was re-call'd, and the Pope declar'd his Nephew, Cardinal <hi>Francis Barberini,</hi> Legate <hi>à Latere,</hi> to come thither and accommodate these Disputes, and endeavour to obtain a Peace to the Republick of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which the Army of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> join'd to that of the King, attack'd at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Campagne, as we come now to declare.</p>
               <p>The Constable of <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> his Son-in-Law, appointing the Rendezvous at <hi>Susa</hi> in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> to confer there with the Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> there agreed on divers Articles, some of which were form'd in presence of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Venice,</hi> and concern'd the League of which I have already spoken. These Articles were publish'd; but besides these, two Papers were signed, which were kept secret: The one, which regarded <hi>Italy,</hi> was to divert and hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to march with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the succour of the <hi>Valteline. Genoua</hi> was to be attack'd under pretext, as hath been said, of <hi>Zuccarello,</hi> an Imperial Fief, on the confines of <hi>Liguria</hi> and <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> The Duke pretended to have it, because the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retti,</hi> who possess'd that Marquisate, had done Homage to <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> unto the Year 1448. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> had purchased it of <hi>Scipio del Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi> in 1588. The <hi>Genouese,</hi> on the contrary, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:187699:69"/> That that Marquisate had been re-united to the Empire, by a Decree of the Emperour, of the 10th. of <hi>December,</hi> in the Year 1622. as well because of the Alienation which <hi>Scipio del Carretto</hi> would have made, as also because of the Excesses by him committed against the Authority of the Emperour, and consequently of that Decree; they had bought that Land, which they kept in their possession till that time.</p>
               <p>Upon this Foundation the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> believ'd he had right to make War upon the <hi>Genouese;</hi> and it was he who ought to declare it, the King of <hi>France</hi> only furnishing him with Succours which he stood in need of. They agreed together about the Number of Troops, Canon, Victuals, Vessels, and other things necessary to conquer the State of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which they look'd upon as easie. This was what was contain'd in one of the Writings; and in the other, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who is accus'd to have made many such Projects, already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Spoils of the <hi>Genouese.</hi> It was made after this manner:</p>
               <p n="1">I. <q>That <hi>Genoua</hi> being taken, it shall remain in the hands of Madam and the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to hold it in Deposite in the Name of the King and Duke, with a Garison of half <hi>French</hi> and half <hi>Savoyards.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <q>That nevertheless the City of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and all the State, should be remitted to his Majesty, as soon as he had consign'd to his Highness <hi>Milan,</hi> and the best part of the <hi>Milanese;</hi> and that the King of <hi>France</hi> should possess <hi>Liguria,</hi> excepting the Marquisate of <hi>Zucca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rello,</hi> and that which is in the great way of <hi>Ormce</hi> and <hi>Oriville,</hi> and all other Lands, from that way unto the County of <hi>Nice,</hi> which should remain unto his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <q>That in case <hi>Genoua</hi> remain'd to the King, with the Kingdom of <hi>Corsica,</hi> and the State of <hi>Genoua</hi> on the East-side, the Duke was to have that on the West.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:187699:70"/> IV. <q>But if the Kingdom of <hi>Corsica</hi> should be freely remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Highness, and all the <hi>Riviera</hi> of <hi>Genoua</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West; the City of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and all the <hi>Riviera</hi> to the East-side should belong to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. <q>That if his Highness were put in possession of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and the <hi>Riviera</hi> of <hi>Genoua</hi> toward the West; the City from <hi>Genoua,</hi> and all the <hi>Riviera</hi> towards the East, with the Kingom of <hi>Corsica,</hi> should remain to the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <q>That if his Majesty shall think good to surrender to his Highness, all the Estates which he possessed before beyond the Mountains, and which his Majesty enjoy'd, and to give to him the City of <hi>Geneva; Genoua</hi> and all its Dependencies, except the Marquisate of <hi>Zuccarello,</hi> and the Lands specified in the 2d. <hi>Article,</hi> are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. <q>That whilst <hi>Genoua</hi> shall be in Deposite, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues shall be divided between his Majesty and his Highness, the Garrison being first paid.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <q>That the Booty shall be divided between them, equally between the Duke and the Constable, the Charges of the Armies being deducted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King accepted those <hi>Articles,</hi> retrenching the 5th. and the 6th, and putting in, That the Lieutenants of the Garrison should be <hi>French,</hi> but nam'd by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and also making some other Alterations of little importance. This Writing was not communicated to the Ambassador of <hi>Venice;</hi> nor was the Republick press'd to be concern'd in this Enterprize, because they would not discover it to them. They only said, that the King and the Duke would attack the Dominions of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> to the end that the <hi>Venetians</hi> might not be jealous.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Treaty was made publick, all those who had any cognizance of the Interests of the Duke of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:187699:70"/>
                  <hi>Savoy,</hi> were astonish'd that Ambition should so far blind <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> that for to aggrandize himself, he would consent to have <hi>France</hi> his Neighbour, as well beyond as on this side the Mountains, and so become totally dependant on that Monarch. By establishing the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and delivering <hi>Genoua</hi> and her Ports to them, they put them in a condition to trouble <hi>Italy</hi> when they pleas'd; and he was oblig'd, in pure good Manners, to attend till the King had taken for him a Moity of the State of <hi>Genoua</hi> which should fall to him, as <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. had formerly taken half of the Lands of <hi>Cremona</hi> from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> after he had parted Stakes with them. Besides that, this was sufficiently clear of it self; Experience hath so well confirm'd the truth of it, that it was not to be doubted but the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> committed an unpardonable Fault in matter of Policy: The Town of <hi>Pignerol</hi> only, which <hi>France</hi> afterwards took from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as you will see in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this History hath put <hi>Piedmont</hi> in the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance as <hi>Savoy,</hi> which the King of <hi>France</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer when he pleases.</p>
               <p>As they design'd to besiege <hi>Genoua</hi> by Sea as well as by Land, a Fleet was necessarily to be provided. They sent into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> for a good number of Ships. In <hi>England</hi> they had nothing but Words and good Hopes; but the <hi>Ʋnited Provinces</hi> agreed to send Twenty Ships well arm'd and furnish'd for six Months, that should put to Sea by the end of <hi>March;</hi> and for their Payment, the Duke and Constable, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this Conquest, engaged all their Fortunes; and the Contract imported, that the Fleet should remain at their Charges until the end of the Expedition.</p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> brought the Articles to the King, and was with pleasure heard at Court on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which the Council only did to fright the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and hinder them from throwing themselves into the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline.</hi> But the Duke, push'd on with heat, promis'd himself to be soon Master of a great part of the Territory of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and perhaps of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd to see a War break out, as he had for a long time earnestly desired, between the two Crowns. The Council sent the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> to his Father-in-Law,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:187699:71"/> and agreed to all which in his Name was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
               <p>Although the King was oblig'd by the Treaty, to send no more than three or four thousand Men into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> he consented that the Constable and the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> should pass the Mountains with Six thousand Foot, and Five hundred Horse. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to have, according to an Article of the League with the King of <hi>France,</hi> Eight thousand Foot, and Two thousand Horse; and by virtue of the Treaty with that King and the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> Twelve thousand Foot and Six hundred Horse. All these Troops, join'd to those of the Constable, form'd an Army formidable to the Republick of <hi>Genoua.</hi>

               <p>Before he pass'd the Mountains, the Constable sent the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles,</hi> Mareschal <hi>de Camp,</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist at a Review of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Army, and to see the Cannon and Ammunition design'd for the Siege of <hi>Genoua.</hi> The Duke shew'd him his Army, compos'd of Sixteen thousand able Men: But the Artillery was not in a very good condition, and the Provision and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition too little for an Enterprize of that Consequence. The Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles</hi> easily perceiv'd it; but the Duke assur'd him so positively that nothing should be wanting, that he believ'd it was not to be doubted. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable came to <hi>Turin</hi> on the 2d. of <hi>February,</hi> with Ten thousand Foot, and Two thousand Horse, which was more than the King had promis'd; but he remonstrated to his Majesty, that it was not honourable for a Constable of <hi>France</hi> to pass the Mountains with a less Army. The King order'd him to leave Six thousand Men in <hi>Bresse,</hi> instead of taking with him all his Forces, excepting two Regiments, of which one went to the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and the other into <hi>Dauphiné.</hi> The strict Alliance which was between the House of <hi>France</hi> and that of <hi>Savoy,</hi> caus'd the King to order the Constable to receive the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Duke, when he was in the Army, and to leave it to him to give the Word. The Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>de Crequi</hi> was to have the same Respect for the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> without suffering it to be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Precedent.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:187699:71"/>
               <p> All the Troops being assembled together, a Review was made of them at <hi>Asti,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>March</hi> 4.</note> where they were found to be but twenty four thousand Foot, and three thousand Horse effective, with twenty four Pieces of great Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and fourteen Field-pieces. Whilst they consulted which way the Army should take, to enter into the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> propos'd to make the Entry by the <hi>Milanese,</hi> or by <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and to secure to themselves one or two places for the passage of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. But the <hi>French</hi> Generals, who had Orders from the King not to touch the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> were for the immediate Attack of <hi>Savona,</hi> a place that could make little resistance, and which would be of great advantage by reason of its Port, because that way they might have all things they should want, come by Sea, and there they might establish the Magazines of the Army. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> stumbled at this; for as the Naval Army which was to favour the attack of <hi>Genoa,</hi> was not yet come, he fear'd that that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Genoeses,</hi> would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Relief to come from <hi>Provence</hi> to <hi>Savona:</hi> If that happen'd, then they must have their Victuals out of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> by Land; and to secure that, it was necessary first to seize the Passages, and to put good Garrisons in them, for fear lest the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should cut off the Provisions from the Army, as soon as this should be brought into the State of <hi>Genoa.</hi> His opinion therefore was, that they should pass through <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and sieze upon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi> and <hi>Capriata.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> reply'd, That on that side the way was too long and too difficult, and that by that March they should give time to the <hi>Genoeses</hi> to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a posture of defence; whereas by marching on the side of <hi>Savona</hi> they should infallibly surprize them; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hindering them of Victuals was little to be fear'd, having but few Garrisons in the <hi>Milanese,</hi> and whose Incursions could not extend very far; That <hi>Piedmont,</hi> although very fruitful, would never fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Victuals enough, and the Carriage that way was very difficult, because of the Rivers which were to be cross'd, and which having no Bridges, would on the least Flood retard the Convoys; That by beginning on the side of <hi>Savona,</hi> they should come to attack <hi>Genoa,</hi> and have the Army fresh and entire for the Siege; whereas
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:187699:72"/> on the other side they must besiege divers Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they might lose abundance of Men, and where they must fatigue an Army, which would ruin the principal Design.</p>
               <p>Though the Constable supported these Reasons, strong in themselves, with all his Authority, the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> whose Sentiments he had Orders to follow, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd firm in his Opinion, in hope to satisfie the Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he had against the House of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to endeavour to appropriate some part of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> He knew that whatsoever Discipline was kept in the Army, his March that way could not but create a great deal of disorder and grievance to the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable could not hinder this Resolution from being taken, because of the Order we before spake of, which perhaps was given to destroy the Enterprize; because it was well known that the Duke was a Prince excessively ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and passionate, and consequently incapable of acting with Moderation enough to make things prosper; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he was a Prince no way to be compar'd to the Constable in matters of War: And this inequality gave him a Jealousie of him from the beginning, with the thoughts, that if the Sentiments of this old Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were follow'd, all the Honour of the Enterprize would redound to him; which the Vanity and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> render'd ineffectual, as shall be seen.</p>
               <p>There was a Rumour some time before, that there was a design against the <hi>Genoeses;</hi> but as the Secret was kept both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Republick doubted of the truth of it, when they should have had an Army ready. The Senators, by whom Republicks are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, being ordinarily better vers'd in the governing of their Houses than in the administration of Affairs of State, often imagine, that in the Republick, as well as in a Family, good Husbandry, or Frugality, is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing of which care is to be taken. By this Opinion they make it their utmost endeavours to hinder unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Expences, and to augment the publick Treasure. It is true, that with Money we may have Men, but there must be time for them also; nor are good Troops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to be had, nor Generals capable to command
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:187699:72"/> them, or such as may without Scruple be trusted. In the interim, the Enemy is many times on his march, and makes great progress against those who have no Army to oppose him: This is just the condition the <hi>Genoese</hi> were in when they pass'd the Mountains; they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Orders for the raising of five thousand <hi>Germans,</hi> which were to be commanded by the Prince <hi>de Bozzolo,</hi> with two hundred Horse, and Magazines of Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Provision very indifferent. They believ'd that this little Body of an Army, supported by the Militia of the Country, would be strong enough to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> superiour both for Number and Quality of Soldiers, without speaking of the <hi>French</hi> Generals, incomparably more experienc'd than theirs. They also trusted to the Situtation of their Country, mountainous and barren, so that great Armies could not subsist without having Victuals from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that Horse are of little use; besides, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> are so much interested in the Conservation of <hi>Genoa,</hi> because of the conveniency of their Ports, and for the Communication of their States in <hi>Italy;</hi> That there was no appearance but they would hasten to their Succour whenever they should be attack'd.</p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> took the Alarm when they saw the Constable in <hi>Italy,</hi> and incessantly sent Couriers into <hi>France,</hi> to endeavour to dive into the Designs of that Court. But it was told them, that the King would declare in time and place; and that if he siez'd on any place in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> it was not to take it away from the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but to hinder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy from making advantage by it, because that Prince was not in a condition to keep it.</p>
               <p>The Sentiment of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> having, as I said, prevail'd, the Army march'd <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>March</hi> 9.</note> towards <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the Constable led the Vanguard, and forc'd his Passage where they would not give it him quietly; <hi>Capriata,</hi> a little City which would not open its Gates, was taken and pillag'd, as well as <hi>Montbarazzo:</hi> He also render'd himself Master of <hi>Aiqui,</hi> which was made the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of the Army, leaving there a Regiment in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with promise to surrender it to the Duke when the Wars should be finish'd. The Constable farther demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:187699:73"/>
                  <hi>Nice de la Paille</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and offer'd him Hostages: But that Prince refus'd it, saying, That he should himself take so much care of its Preservation, that the King's Army should have no reason to fear upon that account any Enemies on that side.</p>
               <p>After this the Army enter'd into the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and went to lodge at <hi>Novi,</hi> which is the Frontier of the <hi>Milanese. George Doria</hi> was in that place with five hundred Men; but having no Provision nor Cannon, he was necessitated on the approach of the Army to open the Gates. <hi>John Jerome Doria, Mestre de Camp,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Republick, abandon'd <hi>Oviedo</hi> for the same Reason; though he had put himself into it with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to defend it, and retir'd himself to <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> which was well provided by <hi>James Spinola.</hi> At the same time the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with two Thirds of the Army, took the way of <hi>Cremolino,</hi> that he might come to <hi>Voltri,</hi> and march along the Coast directly to <hi>Genoa;</hi> which was so terrified by the march of their Enemies, that it was all in disorder. In the mean time the Constable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to complain of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had given him the most part of the Work to manage, with but a third part of the Army, and two Pieces of Cannon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he could have but what his Highness pleas'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on him: He also fear'd that the Duke would take <hi>Genoa</hi> before he could get thither, because he had the longest way to go; so that the Duke would get all the Honour of this Enterprize, whilst the Constable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the greatest part of the Fatigue. This latter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd nevertheless towards <hi>Gavi,</hi> which, he thought, ought to be attack'd, that he might not leave a place behind him; where was, according to the largness of it, a very considerable Garrison. <hi>Benedict Spinola,</hi> who had serv'd a long time in the Wars of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was in the place with fifteen hundred Men; and the Town was supported by a Castle built on a Rock.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> marching towards this Place, intercepted a Letter of <hi>Jerome Piementelli,</hi> General of the Cavalry of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> by which he desir'd <hi>Spinola</hi> to send him five Companies of <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> each to consist of two hundred Men, who were to be on the 24th at <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valle,</hi> from thence to enter into <hi>Gavi.</hi> The Constable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:187699:73"/> sent the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles</hi> with two Regiments, and two Troops of Horse, to charge him in the Passage. The Count of <hi>Alets</hi> join'd himself to them, with six Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of light Horse. On the Day appointed, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> in sight of <hi>Serravalle,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the River <hi>Scrivia,</hi> marching directly to <hi>Serravalle,</hi> whither the River guided them. Though they saw the <hi>French,</hi> yet they continu'd their March, thinking the <hi>French</hi> would not venture over the River to come at them: But the <hi>French</hi> pass'd it, and kill'd two hundred, and took fifty Prisoners; amongst whom was the Commander, and put the rest to flight. This Action was done just on the Territory of <hi>Milan,</hi> yet pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not for a Rupture; and the Prisoners were sent back without paying any Ransom.</p>
               <p>During this, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> advanc'd on the Right Hand of the Constable, and had seiz'd on <hi>Gua,</hi> deserted by <hi>Nicholas Doria,</hi> who had one thousand Foot, and one hundred <hi>Genoese</hi> Gentlemen, with whom he went to <hi>Rossiglione</hi> with two thousand Foot more, to defend the Passages of the Mountains. The Duke having made himself Master of divers other little places, march'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards him, and on <hi>Maundy Thursday</hi> assaulted his Trenches, put him to the rout, and pursu'd him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Campo,</hi> three Leagues from thence, and took that place by Composition.</p>
               <p>This so swift Progress, and the Cowardice of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noese</hi> Officers and Soldiers, put the City into so great a Terror, that if the Duke could have mounted his Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery at <hi>Masone, Genoa</hi> would have been constrain'd to surrender, the old <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops not having yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the place; but the Mountain is too steep and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in this part, to pass any Artillery, without spending a great deal of pains and time. Mean time, on <hi>Good Friday,</hi> the Senate of <hi>Genoa</hi> compos'd of Persons not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd in War, were possess'd with so strange a fright, that it was resolv'd to abandon <hi>Savonne</hi> and <hi>Gavi,</hi> and all the other places, and to bring the Garrisons into the City. But it was to no purpose that they sent these Orders to some of the Commanders, who understood the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of War, and who knew it was impossible for the Duke to pass his Artillery to <hi>Masone;</hi> and that he must,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:187699:74"/> in spight of his Teeth, take the way of <hi>Gavi:</hi> They refus'd to desert those places which were committed to their trust, which was that which occasion'd the safety of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and made them take Courage, and gave them the means to wait for Succours. <hi>John Jerome Doria</hi> made them resolve to defend <hi>Gavi;</hi> because, should it be taken, the Enemies would march directly to <hi>Genoa,</hi> without any further Impediment. He shut up himself in it with <hi>Spinola,</hi> designing to sell it as dear as he could to the Enemies. Whilst <hi>Louis Guasco</hi> found means, by Order of the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> to conduct two thousand Foot and two hundred Horse to <hi>Genoa.</hi> There enter'd into it many <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Officers, who confirm'd the Senate, and were the cause that they forbad, under severe Penalties, any to go out of the City, or to send away any thing whatsoever, as a great number of people had begun to do.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Duke being stopp'd by the Mountain of <hi>Masone,</hi> went to confer with the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Mareschal at St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> where they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Siege of <hi>Gavi,</hi> designing to make that a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine for Provisions, whilst they besieg'd <hi>Genoa. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racciolo,</hi> Camp-master General to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> beyond the <hi>Appennines,</hi> after his entrance into <hi>Genoa,</hi> had posted himself at <hi>Ottagio</hi> with five thousand Foot and some Cavalry, to hinder the Siege of <hi>Gavi,</hi> which is but three Miles distant, in case they should undertake it. At last <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> caus'd his Army to march on that side, to joyn the Constable, and to block up the place on the side towards <hi>Genoa,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> had already done on that of <hi>Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Milan.</hi> The Duke took his Quarters at <hi>Corrasio,</hi> which is a Village about two Miles distant from <hi>Ottagio;</hi> and seeing the Enemy so near him, he sent to view them on the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> without any design to attack them. But the Regiment of <hi>Piemont,</hi> which the Duke had sent for that end, no sooner appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Genoese</hi> Troops left their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, which were at the greatest distance. This Cowardice caus'd the <hi>Piemonteses</hi> to sieze them, and the Duke to advance other Troops, to see what might be done. They assaulted two Forts which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had erected at the end of a narrow Bridge, where the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:187699:74"/> Fight lasted two Hours with equality, the Troops in the Action being supported by fresh ones on each side. By degrees the Armies came to a total Engagement: And the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being advanc'd with his Cavalry a little beyond the Forts, where he perceiv'd those of the <hi>Genoeses</hi> rang'd in Battalia on a Plain. He presently march'd up to them, charg'd them, broke them, and put them to flight: But the Infantry resisted bravely, and retreated not into the City of <hi>Ottagio,</hi> separated from the Suburbs by a Ditch, until they had lost a great many Men. They defended themselves still in this Post very vigorously, until the Duke, having sent two Regiments to the other side of the Town, they set fire to it, and retreated into the Castle. As they were pursu'd they sprung a Mine, which destroy'd many of their Enemies: But as this Castle was too weak to resist a victorious Army, it was forc'd to surrender at Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Duke took Prisoner the General <hi>Caraceiolo, Louis Guasco,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Spinola,</hi> and above six hundred Soldiers. About twelve hundred of the <hi>Genoeses</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> were kill'd, and the Conquerors got only a bloody Victory. The Duke sent seventeen Standards to the King, <note n="*" place="margin">In a I dated <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After this second defeat, much more considerable than that of <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> the <hi>Genoeses</hi> fell into their former Frights, and believ'd they should suddenly see their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital besieg'd.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:187699:75"/> upon him in his Retreat, even to the Walls of <hi>Gavi.</hi> So that to execute the Order of the Duke of <hi>Feria, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza</hi> surrendred the City on the same Day, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Garrison should retire whither they pleas'd. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Giustiniani,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Castle, shew'd how much griev'd he was to surrender, by discharging all the Artillery upon the Town; he answer'd very fiercely when they sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd him to surrender. But when he saw three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries rais'd against the Castle, he demanded leave of the Besiegers to send a Messenger to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Senate of the condition of the place, and promis'd, that if he receiv'd not an Answer in three days, he would give up the Castle. This leave was given: But when the Courier return'd, by whom the Senate order'd him to hold the place as long as he could, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> stopp'd him, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>April</hi> 22.</note> and <hi>Giustiniani,</hi> at the time prefix'd, surrendred on honourable Terms. He brought out of the Castle one hundred and fifty <hi>Corsi,</hi> twenty <hi>Genoeses,</hi> and nineteen <hi>Swissers,</hi> which he led to <hi>Genoa,</hi> where he was put in Prison; it not being known that the Courier which they sent back to him had been detain'd.</p>
               <p>The loss of <hi>Gavi,</hi> which <hi>Meazzo</hi> had promis'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend for ten days at the least; in which the Republick flatter'd it self with receiving Succours from divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, put the <hi>Genoeses</hi> in despair; which was the greater, because all things seem'd to conspire their ruin: But what might have destroy'd them, contributed to their Safety; for the taking of <hi>Gavi</hi> created a misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Duke and the <hi>French</hi> Generals. This Prince presently put some of his own Troops into the Castle, as if he had a design solely to reap the Fruits of the Victory; and the Constable and his Son-in-Law were so angry at it, and complain'd in so bitter Terms, that the Duke was oblig'd to withdraw his people, and to suffer a <hi>French</hi> Garrison to enter it. This Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the propriety of <hi>Gavi,</hi> rais'd a Discourse concerning what Governour should be put into <hi>Genoa</hi> if it were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> pretended, that the Princess of <hi>Piemont</hi> had the Right to name him, because the King of <hi>France</hi> had consented that the place should be deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:187699:75"/> in the Hands of that Princess. But the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to name the Governour; and the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> believ'd, that no other could be named but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, without his manifest wrong. This encreas'd the Jealousie and Misunderstanding between the Duke and the <hi>French.</hi> Two other things happen'd which caus'd a greater disorder: One was, that the Duke had notice that <hi>Stephen Spinola</hi> his Prisoner, had wrote to <hi>Claude de Marines</hi> his Kinsman, Ambassador to the King in <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and to some <hi>French</hi> Officers, that if the Constable would retire out of the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Republick would make a perpetual Alliance with <hi>France.</hi> receive a Resident, and pay the King all the Charges of the War. Besides this, the Duke intercepted two Letters of the Count <hi>de Talard,</hi> who had Correspondents in <hi>Genoa.</hi> This extreamly provo'kd that Prince, who began to make sharp complaints, that <hi>France</hi> should treat with the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeses</hi> without acquainting him with it. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Count <hi>de Talard</hi> had entertain'd no faulty Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence; and <hi>Spinola</hi> had only written to <hi>Marines</hi> in general Terms, as having some advantageous Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to make to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Pass-port of the Constable. The Duke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving instantly put a stop to this Pass-port, <hi>Spinola</hi> was in the interim taken at the Battle of <hi>Oneglia;</hi> and his Highness caus'd him to be kept more strictly than the other Prisoners of War, and would not permit him to be ransom'd, though he was entreated to it by the King of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>The Constable advertis'd his Majesty of all that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and at the same time intreated him to send him a Recruit, because the Army of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being stronger than his, he was necessitated to depend upon him absolutely, and had neither Cannon, Ammunition, nor Victuals, but what he pleas'd.</p>
               <p>The King wrote to the Duke to appease him, and forbid the Constable to hearken to any Proposition of the <hi>Genoeses</hi> which might disoblige the Duke. He sent also six thousand Men, with the Marquis of <hi>Rotelon,</hi> to command the Artillery, and divers other Officers. He moreover order'd the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to put to Sea with the Gallies of <hi>Provence,</hi> to assist the Enterprize of <hi>Genoa;</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:187699:76"/> nevertheless, not to put up the Standard of <hi>France,</hi> and without coming to an open Breach with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For the Vessels which were departed from <hi>Holland</hi> he had caus'd them to be stopp'd near <hi>Rochelle,</hi> to oppose the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> Fleet.</p>
               <p>After the taking of <hi>Gavi,</hi> it was unanimously resolv'd in the Council of War, to attack <hi>Genoa</hi> with all the Forces they had. But as that was a great City, and well peopled, and which consequently could make great resistance, it was judg'd necessary to put the Artillery in a good condition, and to cause store of warlike Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Victuals to be brought, to subsist the Army in the barren Mountains of <hi>Liguria.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had charge of this business, he being oblig'd to furnish the Artillery and Victuals, and to repair the Ways. He promis'd to acquit himself of this Charge, with all the Diligence and Expedition which so pressing an Occasion requir'd. But whether the Measures which he had taken were not right, or that he had not Money enough, the Army waited a long time without seeing any effect of this Promise.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, not to leave it wholly useless, the Duke went to attack <hi>Savignon,</hi> a Castle ten Miles from <hi>Ottagio,</hi> and set it on fire after he had taken it. He at the same time sent the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> to re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Oneglia,</hi> which the <hi>Genoese</hi> had taken, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the other places on the West of the <hi>Riviera.</hi> This Expedition, which lasted to the 8th of <hi>June,</hi> was glorious for the Prince, who subdu'd all the places which he attack'd, and beat the Army which the Republick had sent to oppose his March: It was compos'd of six thousand Mercenaries, and one thousand five hundred of the Country Militia, commanded by <hi>John Jerome Doria.</hi> This General was surrounded by the Prince's Army at the attack of <hi>Pieve,</hi> and made Prisoner with all his Men, except seven or eight hundred who were kill'd on the Spot. The Republick, discourag'd by this Defeat, and sinding themselves no way in condition to succour their Subjects, permitted them to submit to the Conqueror, to prevent pillaging; which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently done by <hi>Ventimiglia, Albengo;</hi> St. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mo,</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mauritio,</hi> open'd the Gates to their Prince as soon as he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:187699:76"/> appear'd. The Gallies of <hi>France,</hi> which at last put to Sea, favour'd the Conquests, but they were quickly forc'd to retreat to the Ports of <hi>Provence,</hi> because the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of St. <hi>Croix,</hi> appear'd in sight of <hi>Genoa</hi> with sixty <hi>Spanish</hi> Gallies.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the Arms of the Duke and the Constable had been as fortunate as they could wish; and there remain'd nothing but the taking of <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Savona,</hi> to render them Masters of all <hi>Liguria.</hi> But the disability of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had embark'd himself in this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, without having wherewithal to support it with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, at such a time when it was most necessary, gave time to the Republick of <hi>Genoa</hi> to draw Succours from <hi>Spain,</hi> and renew its Courage. It had written every way to get Money, which it wanted on this occasion: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Correspondents of the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> who believ'd them lost without retrieve, refus'd to furnish them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, there came <note n="*" place="margin">In the Month <hi>April.</hi>
                  </note> a Galley from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which happily brought a Million of Gold; which put the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in a State immediately to provide for the most urgent Necessities. After this the Marquis of St. <hi>Croix</hi> entred into the Haven with forty Gallies, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with old <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops; and the Duke of <hi>Alcala</hi> conducted thither twelve Galleys more, with Soldiers and Money. It is certain, that in a short time, after the first Frights were over, there were brought to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa</hi> from the Territories of <hi>Spain,</hi> seven Millions of Gold, belonging to private Persons of that City, who in this Emergency lent them to the State. With this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, distributed to the purpose, they procur'd Succour from all parts. They sent considerable Sums to the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> to cause the Troops of the <hi>Milaneses</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and to make new Levies in <hi>Germany.</hi> They pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd also from the <hi>Swissers</hi> liberty of passage through their Country, which they could not have obtain'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, whatsoever political Reasons had been alledg'd to them. These People, who are unacquainted with their Neighbours Interests of State, or who out of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity care not for it, who have almost always with extream coldness heard those who have represented to them, That they ought to contribute to the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balancing those Potentates which have made themselves
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:187699:77"/> too formidable, as that of <hi>France</hi> was at this Juncture. Whoever would gain them must give them Money, which relieving their present Poverty, makes them do what you please without troubling their Heads with the future.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swissers</hi> then having consented that the Levies which were made should pass through their Country; and also given Permission to their Subjects to march un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ensigns of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> dispos'd himself for a March, with the greatest Force he could make, towards the State of <hi>Genoa.</hi> This Motion of the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the numerous Garrison which was in <hi>Genoa,</hi> made the Duke and the Constable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go their desire to attack it, but not to remain without motion: And to assure their Conquests of the <hi>Riviera</hi> to the West, they resolv'd upon the Siege of <hi>Savona,</hi> the taking whereof might terrifie the <hi>Genoeses.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>June</hi> 13.</note> on their march, but was briskly charged in their Rear by the <hi>Milanese</hi> Cavalry, who yet were repuls'd with loss. The Duke and the Constable return'd to <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> where they stay'd till the 22d of <hi>July,</hi> for the new Levies which were making in the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Country. It was here the good Fortune of this Prince stopp'd in its Career, who beheld himself as easily stripp'd of the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> as he had conquer'd it.</p>
               <p>The principal Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> who could neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the growing Greatness of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> nor the Establishment of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> were not backward to shew the concern they had for this Enterprize. The Ambassador of <hi>Venice</hi> at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> receiv'd a Courier express, who brought him Letters, with Orders to make known, that That Republick was so far from having any part in the War against <hi>Genoa;</hi> That she entirely disapprov'd of it, and never knew any thing of it, because she had been given to understand, that the Preparations which had been made, were to be against the <hi>Milanese,</hi> where they intended to make a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diversion; and that it was to be fear'd, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> would enter into the <hi>Valteline</hi> with thirty thousand Men, and drive the Marquiss <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> from thence. The Ambassador added, That
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:187699:77"/> this latter had also demanded Succours of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; which she could not furnish him withal, because she had occasion for all the Forces she could raise else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The Cardinal, in answer to these Discourses of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassador, said, That the Republick acted against its own Interests; because, if the King could make himself Master of <hi>Genoa,</hi> he would infallibly be so likewise of the <hi>Milanese;</hi> of which he would give one half to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the other to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But the Ambassador, far from being taken in this Snare, visited all the Foreign Ministers which were at <hi>Paris,</hi> and declar'd to them, That tho' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick had leagued it self with the King and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to draw the <hi>Valteline</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> yet she knew nothing of the design which they had against <hi>Genoa.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> did so much the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily persuade the other Potentates of the truth of what they said, that it was visible it was contrary to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests that the Republick of <hi>Genoa</hi> should be destroy'd, since instead of a State which disquieted no body, nor caus'd any Jealousies to their neighbouring Princes, they pretended to introduce a formidable Power, which would trouble the quiet of all <hi>Italy,</hi> whenever he should think it for his Interest. <hi>Ʋrban</hi> VIII, for the same Reason or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Galleys to joyn with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to hinder the Attack of the <hi>Genoeses</hi> by Sea.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>France</hi> was of Opinion, that the Design sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld be maintain'd until <hi>Genoa</hi> was taken; and all endeavours were to be us'd to reconcile the Duke to the Constable, and to prevent the Quarrels which might still happen between them. An Agreement was made as to a Governour of <hi>Genoa</hi> when it should be taken; and they agreed the Person should be the Mareschal <hi>de Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> as very proper for that Employ. But whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the Duke could make to have the Castle of <hi>Gavi,</hi> the Court adjudg'd it to the Constable, and approv'd of his Conduct in this Affair. The Duke still continu'd his Complaints, and accus'd him of detaining from the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers a great part of their Pay; by which means a good part were forc'd to desert for want of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence. He also affirm'd, That this General had made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> secret Treaty with the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> and had that way
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:187699:78"/> drawn a considerable Sum of Money from them. The Constable on his part complain'd, That the Duke daily spread Reports to defame him, and accus'd this Prince openly to have embark'd himself in this Enterprise, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having Forces sufficient to execute it, and had broke his Promise. Their differences were carried to so great a height, that the Duke pray'd the King to recall the Constable and the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> and to send the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> in their place. The Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> had entertain'd this last several times, when the <hi>French</hi> Galleys were at <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and the Duke being return'd into <hi>Provence,</hi> endeavour'd there to raise six thousand Men for the House of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The King would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to recall the Constable, perceiving plainly, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> intended to cast the ill Success of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise on the Constable; and for fear lest the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should enter into <hi>Piemont</hi> to revenge their Losses which they had receiv'd by the <hi>French,</hi> he gave Orders for eight thousand Foot and three thousand Horse, to pass the Mountains. Although there had yet been no design to break with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> openly, they believ'd that on this occasion a Rupture might contribute to bring them to a Treaty more advantageous to <hi>France:</hi> This was the opinion of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who incessantly urged the Court to send an Army into the <hi>Milanese;</hi> without which no satisfaction would be got from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Subjects of <hi>Genoa</hi> reassum'd their Courage, and contributed much to the driving out of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards.</hi> There is a Valley in the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> to the West of the City, and not far from it, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pozzevera,</hi> whose Inhabitants discharged their Duty very well on this occasion. This Valley is extreamly well peopled; and lies between the highest Crags of the <hi>Appennine,</hi> so that the Inhabitants can easily defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Incursions of their Enemies; besides, they are naturally fierce, and would be proper for War, were care taken to exercise them. These People being well provided of Arms and Ammunition, kill'd or took Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as many <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> as they found stragling from the Body of the Army; so that not daring to march out, they were, as it were, besieg'd in their Camp.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:187699:78"/> The <hi>Montferrins,</hi> on the other side, to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Army for plundering, took their Convoys every moment; which did them great Mischief. The Famine coming into the Camp, and Maladies becoming frequent, together with the Desertions of Soldiers, were so continual, that the Army could not subsist in this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Country. Those of <hi>Pozzevera,</hi> who knew all the ways and turnings of the Mountains, did at the same time make a bold Attempt to take away five hundred Beefs, which were in a Meadow in sight of the Camp, and which serv'd to draw the Artillery.</p>
               <p>The Army being parted from <hi>Aiqui,</hi> took the way to <hi>Savona,</hi> and in their March rendred themselves Masters of <hi>Cairo</hi> by Composition. But the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving discover'd its design, departed from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to endeavour the Preservation of <hi>Savona,</hi> with twenty two thousand Foot, and five thousand Horse. Resolving to have no regard for the <hi>French,</hi> though as yet there had been no breach, he put himself to march in their Ships to traverse their Enterprizes. He came before <hi>Aiqui,</hi> a few Days after the departure of the Duke and the Constable, and began to assail the place with so much vigour, that he took it by Capitulation, and constrain'd two thousand five hundred Foot to go out of it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> found in this place the greatest part of the Munitions for War and Mouth of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> Army: And it was said, that part of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Baggage was there also; in which were most magnificent Liveries, which he had caus'd to be made for his Entrance into <hi>Genoa,</hi> as in Triumph; so strangely was he assur'd of the Success of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
               <p>The Constable was at <hi>Spigno</hi> when he receiv'd the news that <hi>Aiqui</hi> was taken, and he presently sent to recall the Army, which marched to <hi>Savona</hi> under Conduct of of the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi.</hi> After this the Duke and the Constable resolv'd to retreat to <hi>Asti,</hi> passing by the side of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army. This Resolution was founded upon <hi>Savona</hi>'s being provided with a good Garrison, and the Marquis <hi>de St. Croix</hi> being expected daily with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet; so that there was no probability of taking that place, if well defended, in the sight of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:187699:79"/>
               <p> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on this occasion had great Advantages over their Enemies, had they known how to make use of them. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyard</hi> Army was fatigu'd, weaken'd, loaded with Baggage, and hardly got for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward its Artillery, which was in disorder, in a way full of Hills, and which they were often fain to level with the Spade and Mattock, to make way for their Cannon. Besides this, they were to pass over the Rivet <hi>Tanare,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could come to <hi>Asti;</hi> and if the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> had posted himself on the Pass, he would strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have embarassed the Constable: The <hi>Spanish</hi> Army was wholly fresh, in good state, and also very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Whilst it might have had the Front of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards,</hi> the Marquis of St. <hi>Croix</hi> might have charg'd them in the Rear; so that it would have been hard for them to have extricated themselves out of this difficulty without loss.</p>
               <p>The Constable, though Fourscore Years old, would have the Rear-guard in this Retreat, as he had the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard at their entring into the States of <hi>Genoua.</hi> He staid at <hi>Bestagne</hi> two days with the Cavalry, and caus'd the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> to depart the day before with the Artillery; the Constable follow'd him the day after, and marched with the Army in that manner, that he kept the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on his right hand, and the Baggage on his left. He advanced thus for three days unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli,</hi> not being distant from the Enemy, who flanked him but few miles. In fine, all the Army arriv'd at <hi>Asti,</hi> with its Baggage and Artillery, without receiving any loss from the Enemy. This Retreat was more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Constable and the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> than all their preceeding Conquests had been. Though we cannot praise the Bravery and Capacity of the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> in this Rencounter, wherein he suffer'd the Enemy to escape his hands; yet the Expedition he made to bring Succours to the State of <hi>Genoua,</hi> a Friend to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> is certainly to be commended. It was every-where extoll'd what care the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had taken to support a Power, which would have been trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down, had they not run with more readiness than they us'd in their own Affairs.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:187699:79"/>
               <p> When the Enemy's Army was thus retir'd, the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouese</hi> took the Campagne, to recover what they had lost, and beginning with the <hi>Riviera</hi> of the West: They did it with such swiftness, that the Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who was commanded to oppose their Designs, with the best Troops of the Duke his Father, had no time to do it.</p>
               <p>The Commanders and the Troops which were left in the Places, defended themselves but little better than the <hi>Genouese</hi> had done; and all the State of <hi>Genoua</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd in a few Days to its ancient Masters. Thus the Ambition of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Avarice of the Constable, who had before-hand divided other Men's Goods, and who believ'd themselves sure to plunder the Riches of the <hi>Genoueses,</hi> found themselves deceiv'd. Which ordinarily happens in these sort of Enterprizes, where they meet with unexpected Obstacles, be it on the Enemy's side, or those who are the Assailants, and who usually fall out amongst themselves.</p>
               <p>The Constable and the Duke <hi>de Crequi</hi> wrote to the Court to give an account of the State of Affairs, and to engage the King to send Twenty five thousand Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Mountains, that the War might be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Milanese,</hi> to be reveng'd of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had defeated their Enterprize on <hi>Genoua.</hi> They had at first some inclination to do it, and gave great Hopes to these Generals; but a little while after, that design was alter'd; and nothing was spoken of, but to accommodate the Affair of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> by the way of Treaty, as will appear in the sequel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not content to have chased the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> out of the State of <hi>Genoua,</hi> pursued them even into <hi>Piemont,</hi> to punish the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for having dared to attack the Allies of <hi>Spain,</hi> besides his still making profession of his Enmity to that Crown. The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> therefore encamp'd within three Miles of <hi>Asti,</hi> whither the <hi>French</hi> had retreated. He came thither at the time that the Constable was fallen sick of a Flux, with a Fever and Vomiting, which is always thought mortal to a Man of his Age. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> had also the Tertian Ague; so that they retir'd themselves to <hi>Turin</hi> to regain their Health.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:187699:80"/> The other General Officers were also indispos'd, except the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Asti.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> having notice of these things, put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a posture to make use of the occasion, and went and encamp'd very near <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 31.</note>
                  <hi>Asti,</hi> making show as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to besiege it.</p>
               <p>This Duke was no Man of War: The King of <hi>Spain</hi> had sent to him from <hi>Flanders, Don Gonsales de Cordova,</hi> to assist him with his Counsel, and to Command the Army under his Name. This <hi>Spaniard</hi> wanted not Courage; but he had not the Qualities of a General, and knew not how to bring, what he undertook, to pass. They then observed in <hi>Spain</hi> two essential Faults, which had stopp'd the progress of that vast Monarchy, and which caus'd it to be the Loser in all Wars which it made: The one was, that it wanted Generals, the Grandees plunging themselves into Voluptuousness in their Infancy, and rendring themselves uncapable of any thing, by a soft and effeminate Life. This Defect might have been supplied, by making use of foreign Generals, and yet Subjects of the House of <hi>Austria:</hi> But the Envy or natural Contempt which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have for other Nations, have always hindred them from having recourle to Strangers. The other Defect is, the ill Management of the Treasury, which caus'd the King to be at infinite Expences, and yet paid not his Armies, from whence proceeded desertions of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or else they mutined, and were incapable of Action.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> and <hi>Don Gonsales de Cordova,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to besiege <hi>Asti,</hi> upon Advice which was given them, that the Place was unprovided for a Siege. But perceiving from the beginning, that they should find more difficulty in this Siege than they believ'd, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>August</hi> 3.</note> three days after. They were charg'd in the Reer, by the Troops which were in <hi>Asti,</hi> and by the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who was return'd from <hi>Turin:</hi> As for the Constable, he pass'd the Mountains with all speed possible, and caused himself to be carried to <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> in <hi>Dauphiné.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Spain</hi> would gladly have had the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> have taken some Place in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:187699:80"/> he have done it, but they were not willing that he should retain a considerable Party; so that to satisfie that Order, and to repair the Faults which he had committed, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to march and besiege <hi>Verruē,</hi> a Place considerable by its situation, but at that time very weak, and defended by a very small Garrison. He promised to himself to carry this Town in a few days, and afterwards to make himself Master of <hi>Crescentino,</hi> which lies over-against it on the other side of the <hi>Po.</hi> By taking these two Places, which are almost in the middle of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he hoped to curb the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> so, that he should not be in a condition to do <hi>Spain</hi> any hurt; besides, that those Conquests would enable him to subsist his Troops, without any charge to the <hi>Milanese.</hi> This Design appear'd so much the better laid, because there were not then in <hi>Verruē</hi> above Eight or Nine hundred regular Troops, and some Militia. There were no Fortisications but a Half-moon at the head of the Suburbs; all the rest were not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the situation of the Place was so advantageous, being on a high Hill, and wash'd on one side with the <hi>Po,</hi> that it supplied the want of Fortifications. Yet had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> presently attack'd it vigorously, in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance they had taken it by storm. But some Vollies of Cannon-shot so terrified them when they openly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd it, that they resolv'd to besiege it formally, in making their Approaches after the manner accustom'd in Sieges of strong Places. They began this Siege on the 7th. of <hi>August;</hi> and their Army, besides the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Soldiers it had already, which were about Twenty four thousand Foot, and Four thousand Horse, receiv'd Recruits thrice, without being able to take the Place. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was advised to abandon it, believing it could not be maintain'd against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army; but the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> endeavour'd three times to put in Succours, and to maintain it: For this end he marched with 12000 Men, half <hi>French,</hi> and half <hi>Savoyards,</hi> towards a Bridge which the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> had made over the <hi>Po</hi> above <hi>Verruē,</hi> and caused the <hi>French</hi> Troops to pass, who intrench'd themselves at the head of the Bridge, in the sight of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and put into <hi>Verruē</hi> Succours of Victuals, Men, and Ammunition, which it wanted. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> presently perceiv'd,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:187699:81"/> that whilst that Bridge stood, or should be in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> it would be impossible for them to take the Place. Wherefore they made their principal Efforts to ruin it, or to render themselves Masters of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment. They four times with Cannon-shot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd the Bridge, which as many times was repair'd. The fifth time, the River being swell'd, carried away the Materials; and the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> had a very fair opportunity to attack the Intrenchment kept by the <hi>French,</hi> whilst they could not be reliev'd from the other side the <hi>Po.</hi> There were divers attempts made by each side, to gain or recover such Posts as were judged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. About the 11th. of <hi>November,</hi> when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable was return'd out of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> in the head of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Re-inforcement, he, with the Troops of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> attack'd divers Forts which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had made in the Plain, to secure their Convoys, and took them all without any considerable loss. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon this went out of their Lines to regain them; but could recover only one, which was nearest to their Camp, and were repulsed throughout with loss, after a Fight which lasted four Hours. This obliged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to raise the Siege immediately in a hurry, for feat the French should fall upon them in their Camp.</p>
               <p>The Constancy and Bravery of the <hi>French</hi> appear'd on this occasion in the defence of their Retrenchments, as also their Patience to endure labour in the pains they took to make them, as well as the Bridge which they defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They frighted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a manner of fighting, to which they were not accustom'd: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of amusing themselves at Club-Musquet, they march'd streight upon them with their Swords drawn, and drove them into their Retrenchments. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were generally blam'd for having lost two thirds of an Army of forty thousand Men before a little paltry Town, without being able to take it, by reason of the small Ability of their Commanders.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> receiv'd the highest Satisfaction, that he had in some sort been able to revenge on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Injury they had done him, in taking out of his Power, as he believ'd, the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> when he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:187699:81"/> was just on the point to attack it. He gave out, that he would return thither, but only for the consideration that he wanted a Naval Army, to chase away that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> which restrain'd him. He purpos'd therefore to follow the Army of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them at <hi>Pontesture,</hi> where it lay encamp'd, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to penetrate into the <hi>Milanese;</hi> his principal design being to engage the two Crowns in a long War, that he might, according to the Proverb, <hi>Fish in troubled Waters.</hi> The Constable, and the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> were as willing as he to be reveng'd on the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but the evil Success of the Enterprize of <hi>Genoa</hi> had made them more reserv'd, and they would not employ the King's Arms but where they were assur'd to retreat both with Honour and Profit. As to what regarded the assailing of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army at <hi>Pontesture,</hi> they thought it too dangerous, it having still forty thousand effective Men, and had Cannon and Ammunition enough to defend that Post, which is upon the <hi>Po.</hi> and by which it might draw whatever it wanted out of the <hi>Milanese.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Season being advanc'd, did also prohibit them from undertaking the Siege of any place in the <hi>Milanese;</hi> and besides, the Army was not strong enough for such an Enterprize. They might easily enter into the <hi>Spanish</hi> Territories; but the <hi>French</hi> Generals judged it dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the King's Forces, to make an inroad only, and then a Retreat. The Duke propos'd, nevertheless, to besiege <hi>Novaro,</hi> which was in no condition to resist; and these Generals, after some Scruples, offer'd him their Troops. The Duke appointed the time for the march of the Army; but the excessive Rains put a sudden stop to this Design, which they after left quite off, when they heard that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had sent Troops and Munitions into <hi>Novaro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Project not taking, the Duke was positive for entring into the <hi>Milanese</hi> on another side; but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and the Mareschal oppos'd it for two Reasons, besides the former: The first was, That the King's Forces ought not to set foot there, till the <hi>Venetians</hi> had entred in at the same time; and the <hi>Venetians</hi> excus'd their doing it, until the King had first invaded it with two and twenty thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:187699:82"/> and that the Duke had so many in readiness as he was oblig'd to have; That it was to no purpose to undertake this Expedition in Winter, and without Cannon. The Duke replied to these Reasons, That if the King would send but eight thousand Men into the <hi>Milanese,</hi> the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> would not fail to enter, for the great advantages their Republick might reap by it; and as for him he was ready to march, with the number of Troops he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to have. However the Constable's Reasons, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the King's Orders, prevail'd, and the Troops were sent to garrison in several places of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> This augmented not a little the disgust which the Duke had conceiv'd against the Constable; and afterwards, in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> this latter, with the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> withdrew themselves to <hi>Grenoble.</hi> This was the end of the Enterprize of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which I have orderly, and somewhat fully related, though the Cardinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it no more particularly than the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors of State; because it was a signal Example of that which the Fable calls, <hi>To sell or divide the Bear's skin.</hi> It further shews, of what importance it is not to despair because of the progress of an Enemy, as long as one place remains defensible; since the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to endure a Siege, notwithstanding all the Losses they had suffer'd, made a fortunate end of the Affair, without being guilty of any baseness, as other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have often been, who have sent the Keys of their Towns to their Enemies, without staying for so much as a Summons.</p>
               <p>We are now to return to other things which happened in <hi>France</hi> in the same Year, and in which the Cardinal was much more concern'd. The King being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd by the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>March</hi> 23.</note> Nuncio, that the Pope had sent Cardinal <hi>Barbarin</hi> Legat into <hi>France,</hi> seem'd very well pleas'd: But when the Nuncio demanded a suspension of Arms between the two Crowns, until a Peace was concluded, he referr'd him to the Council. In the mean time, the Nuncio represented, that the two Months Suspension al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready agreed on, would soon be expir'd, before any thing wrs concluded on. The King wrote to the Count of <hi>Bethune,</hi> That after the two Months were expir'd, they should agree to twenty or twenty five Days more; of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:187699:82"/> which notice was given to the Nuncio; who was for a suspension of Arms likewise for the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> since the Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> came to accommodate that Affair, as well as the other of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> but whatever he could say, it would not be taken notice of. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> who would not contradict whatever was done in favour of the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> oppos'd with all their might the Suspension which the Pope demanded for the <hi>Valteline;</hi> the Ambassador of <hi>Savoy</hi> oppos'd it too with all his Power.</p>
               <p>A while after it was propos'd to the Pope on behalf of <hi>France,</hi> That to satisfie him, they would offer to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him the Forts of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> on condition he would content himself with that Offer, without pressing the Accomplishment, because there was no necessity of it for the Honour of his Holiness. They would also promise an exact observation of the Suspension; which <hi>France</hi> did nevertheless more by force than any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Pope, since the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> was weaker than the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Court gave not over to write to him, that if an opportunity presented to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the King's Affairs, he was not too nicely to regard the Suspension.</p>
               <p>In the Interim the Legat advanc'd towards <hi>Paris,</hi> where he entred the 21st of <hi>May,</hi> after they had taken away some difficulties about enregistring his Bulls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King was only styl'd, <hi>King of France,</hi> and not <hi>King of Navarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had had the first Audience of Ceremony, he teceiv'd <note n="*" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> another, in which he exhorted the King to a Peace, to remit the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline</hi> into the same Estate they were before these Brouille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to make a general Cessation of Arms in <hi>Italy.</hi> The King answer'd, That he was very much inclin'd to a Peace, and should be always so, provided it might be certain and honourable to him and his Confederates; That as to what regarded the <hi>Valteline,</hi> it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Estate it was in before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made seisure of it; That, in fine, the Suspension of Arms, of which mention was made, could not but be prejudicial to him as well as to his Allies. The Legate further urg'd the King to cause all Hostilities against the <hi>Genoeses</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:187699:83"/> to cease; but the King replied, that he could not desert the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> In the third Audience the King still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to the Legate the suspension of Arms; altho' the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal declar'd, That without that the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> would openly succour the Republick of <hi>Genoa.</hi> The King replied, That though he had endeavour'd not to come to a Rupture with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet if they first took up Arms against him, he should be the last would lay them down.</p>
               <p>The Legate had also a long Conference with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> (for after the disgrace of <hi>Vieville</hi> he had return'd into favour,) and <hi>Herbault,</hi> Secretary of State, who came to his Lodgings. The Legat would have with him the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio <hi>Spada,</hi> and <hi>Azzolini,</hi> Secretary of the Legation. He made the same demands to the Ministers as he had done to the King; and the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> answer'd him, That his Majesty had already declar'd, that he would not agree to them, and brought many Reasons to make it appear, that the King could not, nay ought not to consent to the suspension of Arms, for fear lest his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies should make use of it, to assemble all their Forces, in order to act with more vigour against him and his Allies; That a Peace might as easily be made as a Truce, the Conditions whereof would be as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to accommodate as those of a Peace; That if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would observe the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that greater assurance might be provided for the Catholick Religion in the <hi>Valteline.</hi> As to what regarded the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which his Holiness demanded, he prayed the Legat to remember, That the King had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented that the <hi>Valteline</hi> should be deposited in the Pope's Hands, but only on condition, and in a time limited, that the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> should be executed; That the length of Negotiations, without ever coming to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molition of the Forts, the instances of the Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the several particulars which he had propos'd to his Holiness, before the <hi>Grisons</hi> made an Insurrection to bring it to that, was the only Remedy for these Differences. The arrival of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in the <hi>Valteline</hi> before the <hi>Grisons,</hi> or at the same time which they entred, and the respect which <hi>Coeuvres</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:187699:83"/> always shew'd to his Holinesses Ensigns, had sufficiently justified the Conduct of <hi>France;</hi> and yet, nevertheless, the King refus'd not for his part to do all that could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be demanded of him; That it was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to determine the Conditions, which would be very different if they should come to accommodation, or if they should enter into an open War; But that the King would cause his Ambassador to tell his Holiness, That for the Honour of the Party, it should be permitted him to advance; and that when the Peace was assur'd, the King would remit the Castle of <hi>Chiavenna</hi> at the same time that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should surrender to him that of <hi>Riva,</hi> to be both razed, and the same should be done as to the rest.</p>
               <p>The Legat said the same things over again at the fourth Audience, excepting that he still spoke of the security of the Catholick Religion in the <hi>Valteline.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it had not been demanded of the Legat, if he had any Power to treat in the Name of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> because his Character of Legat sufficed for his making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions he had already made. But when he begun to speak of the Establishment of the Catholick Religion in the <hi>Valteline;</hi> which was an essential Point, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to diminish the Authority of the <hi>Grisons</hi> in that Country, it was demanded of him, whether he had Authority to treat, and to cause what was to be agreed upon to be put in execution. The Legat answer'd, That he had no other Power than what the Pope had given him; but that if he could accommodate the two Crowns, he doubted not but it would be well approv'd of. Doubts arose upon this answer, whether a Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was to be entred into with him: But as that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him to nothing, they resolv'd to do it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the Consideration which <hi>France</hi> had for the Legat, and the good Disposition she was in towards a Peace.</p>
               <p>As for the suspension of Arms, the same thing was answer'd; so that not to stop the Negotiation, it was said, that That Article should be left undecided, and they would pass on to others. The Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> then said, That in regard of the Satisfaction which the Pope demanded, the King would write to him, and tell him
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:187699:84"/> by his Ambassador, in Terms which should do no hurt, neither to the Honour of him who spoke, nor the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of him to whom they were address'd. On the Article of Peace he said. That if it were made, his Majesty would order the Commanders of the Forts of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> to remit them into the Hands of such Governours as the Pope should send, on condition that the Garrisons of the Pope, and those of the King should join together to demolish them, to the end it might quickly be done; or if this would not please his Holiness, he would cause them to be demolish'd successively; and that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not begin with the Fort of <hi>Riva,</hi> it should be done after such a manner, that they which the King first remitted, should at the same time be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish'd. Although this satisfaction which was offer'd the Pope contain'd nothing which was precise, the Legat said, It was easie to agree of Words, which the King and his Ambassador might make use of, as the Formality which should purposely be made use of for the demolishing of the Forts of the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greatest concern'd the security of the Catholick Religion in that Country; upon which the Legat said, That it belong'd to the Pope solely privatively from all others, to regulate that which regarded the Catholick Religion; and for the greater security of the Catholick Inhabitants of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> ways were to be sought out to free them from the power of the <hi>Grisons.</hi> The King answer'd, That he would willingly have the Catholick Religion, and Catholick People of the <hi>Valteline</hi> put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Covert, but would not have the Interests of State, confounded with those of that Religion, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would never suffer any thing to be done which might bring prejudice to the Sovereignty which the <hi>Grisons</hi> his Allies had on the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
               </p>

                     <hi>June</hi> 20. <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 5. p. 862.</note> another Conference this Point was treated on much longer, and the Legat maintain'd, That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion could not be secur'd in that Country, without <hi>some moderating of the Authority of the</hi> Grisons, (for these are the Terms he made use of;) for if they were Masters both of the Justice and the Garrisons, it was to be fear'd lest they should abuse it, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Franchises and Consciences of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:187699:84"/> of the <hi>Valteline.</hi> The King's Ministers replied, with Reason, That Divine and Human Laws requir'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Sovereign that which of Right belong'd to him; That the <hi>Grisons</hi> were in possession, which none could deny, of the Sovereignty of that Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entred it; That it could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to be surrendred to them, under pretence that a good part of the Inhabitants of that Country were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; That the King acted for the <hi>Grisons</hi> as their Confederate, and their Protector; and having taken Arms to re-establish them in their Rights, it was not for his Honour to consent to the diminution of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; That for the greater security of the Religion, the King was willing to enter into the Treaty, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Arms to make it be observ'd; That it should be declared, that if the <hi>Grisons</hi> should controvert the Regulation which should be made concerning the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they should forfeit their Sovereignty, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should appertain to the King and the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly. The Legat, who was not satisfied with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, propos'd divers particulars, by which he took away either in the whole or in part, the Sovereignty of the <hi>Valteline</hi> from the <hi>Grisons,</hi> under pretext of securing the Catholick Religion; but they were rejected for the Reasons already given. Notwithstanding a Project of Articles was put into the Hands of the Legat, of which one part regarded Religion, and the other the Civil Power, the Legat who was not above twenty four Years old, durst do nothing on this occasion of his own Head, but only as he was limited by his Orders: Wherefore he sent those Articles to his Uncle by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, to know the Sentiments of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time he could conclude nothing, because in all the Conferences he only repeated the same Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and the <hi>French</hi> still gave him the same Answers. This vex'd the Pope, who was otherwise very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Honours they had done his Nephew in <hi>France,</hi> but who saw with regret, that as to the bottom of Affairs he could advance nothing; So that his Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beacme useless.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:187699:85"/>
               <p> In the mean time the suspension of Arms was expir'd on the 10th of <hi>May;</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Coeuvres</hi> was troubled because of the Arrival of the Counts <hi>de Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim</hi> and <hi>de Serbellin</hi> at <hi>Riva</hi> with new Troops. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, he began to observe a great coldness in the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> concerning the Affairs of the League. During some Months they had done nothing but urg'd the King to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Milanese,</hi> and to declare War with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> and seeing him once engag'd, instead of succouring him as they had promis'd, they started a hundred diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the execution of the Treaty. In effect, their design was not to render <hi>France</hi> powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> at the cost of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but only to engage them against them, that they might not have them sit on their skirts. The King on his part, endeavour'd only to exclude the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> from the passage of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> with a handful of people, which he thought to have got sustain'd by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army, without being oblig'd to send an Army into the <hi>Milanese.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres,</hi> not to be idle, and to preserve the Reputation which he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, resolv'd to attack <hi>Nova,</hi> which would serve for a near Blockade to <hi>Riva.</hi> For this end he caus'd two great pieces of Cannon to be brought from <hi>Bergamo,</hi> and compleated the <hi>Swiss</hi> Regiment of <hi>Salis,</hi> to which the Guard of <hi>Chiavenna</hi> had been committed. He sent also two armed <hi>Venetian</hi> Barks in the Lake of <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> to prohibit the Portage of Victuals by Water to <hi>Riva.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> rendred these Barks useless, by putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the same Lake, and placing some Cannon on divers places of the sides. <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> after he had lost much time about this, gave Orders to all his Troops to march directly to <hi>Nova,</hi> making account to fall upon it in the Night, and raise a Battery against this place, and to attack it the day following, as soon as the Breach was made. But his Orders not being well executed, instead of the Attack which was propos'd to be made, all the Army was engag'd otherwise than he design'd. <hi>Vaube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> having lodg'd three Companies of the Regiment of <hi>Normandy,</hi> near the Ditch of <hi>Codaire,</hi> he found they were separated from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by this Ditch only, which made him to begin the Skirmish with them; in which they were supported by one Regiment, and after by the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:187699:85"/> whole Army: The Combat was very sharp, and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, that it lasted till late in the Night. The <hi>French</hi> there had the worst, and left two hundred dead on the place, and besides had a great many wounded. This disadvantage broke the Design they had upon <hi>Nova,</hi> and they retook it not afterwards for want of observing in the execution (better than they had before done) the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty there was to bring their Cannon to it. In the Months of <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> there reigned so many Diseases among the <hi>French,</hi> little accustom'd to the Heats of the Climate in which they were, and who eat the Fruits of the Country too greedily for their Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Army was lessen'd more than one half; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that reckoning the Aids of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they had not more than Three thousand Men, and most of the Officers were sick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops were not exempt from these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, but the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Milanese</hi> afforded them better comfort; and instead of the Sick, which were sent thither, there came fresh Soldiers; so that their Troops appear'd but little diminish'd. <hi>Coeuvres</hi> often demanded Recruits from the Court, and some Levies were made among the <hi>Swiss</hi> and the <hi>Grisons;</hi> but it was not till towards the end of the Year, and those not very numerous. He press'd the <hi>Venetians</hi> also to send him Succours, and threatned them to retreat to <hi>Sandrio,</hi> or to <hi>Tirano,</hi> which would give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> opportunity to make Excursions into their Territories: But notwithstanding all these Instances, they remain'd immovable.</p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>de Roquelaure</hi> being dead, the King, in the Month of <hi>August,</hi> gave a Mareschals Staff of <hi>France</hi> to the Count of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> which he had long since pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him. <hi>Coeuvres</hi> endeavour'd to obtain one, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King to give him that of the Mareschal <hi>de Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who died some Years ago, and to whom no Person had been substituted. He added, That if his Majesty was not disposed to give it him presently, he supplicated him that the Brief might be expedited. But he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, that the King no more gave Briefs for those sort of Gratifications; and the Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu</hi> wrote to him, That it was more glorious for him to wait till
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:187699:86"/> the King did him that favour of his proper motion, than to extort it by Importunities. There were two Obstacles which hinder'd his receiving this Recompence; one was, that a report had been raised, that the King had given him a Mareschal's Staff, after the Invasion of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line;</hi> the Nuncio <hi>Spada</hi> had strongly oppos'd it; and had declar'd, that that would be to affront his Holiness, to recompence a man after that manner, who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him; and make it appear, that he had done all things by order, though the contrary was pretended. The other Obstacle was, that Monsieur demanded the same thing for the Colonel <hi>d'Ornano,</hi> his Governour.</p>
               <p>The Arms of <hi>France</hi> having no farther happy success than they had lately in the state of <hi>Genoa</hi> and the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hoped that she might come to a conclusion in the Affair of the <hi>Valteline</hi> with the greater facility; but the King's Ministers would by no means hear of despoiling the <hi>Grisons</hi> of the Sovereignty of that Valley. In the middle of <hi>July,</hi> the Legat sent the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio to the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to conferr with him thereupon; and he receiv'd the same Answer from him. <hi>Spada</hi> replied, That the Legat could conclude no Treaty which should confirm the <hi>Grisons</hi> in the Restitution of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> because it was incompatible with the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Catholick Religion, without which, no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, much less a Legat, could make any Proceedings: That the Pope had order'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Legat in <hi>France,</hi> a good number of Divines to examine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the bottom; and though they could not foresee what their Determination would be, there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Accommodation, at least if the Advantage was not to the Catholick Religion in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and care were not taken of the Reputation of the Apostolick See, and that of the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Cardinal promised that care should be taken of all these; but he made no particular Proposition thereupon.</p>
               <p>Whilst the Legat was at the Court, the Deputies of the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubise</hi> came thither, to treat for their Reconciliation. The Legat took this for an Affront; because he pretended, that before they heard the Deputies, they should have finish'd the Affair with him; but he was yet more angry, when he saw the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:187699:86"/> Peace between the King and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> publish'd with sound of Trumpet; and he very well apprehended his Negotiation would become more difficult. The Court was not a little glad to find an opportunity to extinguish a domestick Flame, before it spread too far, in the fear it was in suddenly to enter into a War with <hi>Spain.</hi>

From thence he pretended to keep all the Neighbouring Coasts under check, and to retreat thither with all the Prizes he got in his Cruizings. Those of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> on their side, over-run all the Neighbourhood, in spight of all the care of <hi>Thoiras</hi> Governour of <hi>Fort-Lewis;</hi> of the Mareschal of <hi>Pralin,</hi> Governour of <hi>Saintonge;</hi> and of the Count of <hi>Rochefoucaud,</hi> Governour of <hi>Poictou,</hi> who had raised some Troops to prevent their Excursions. <hi>Soubise</hi> made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent on the Coast of <hi>Olonne;</hi> but he was constrain'd, by the Mareschal <hi>de Pralin</hi> quickly to return on board his Vessels. He was more fortunate in the Descent which he afterwards made on the Banks of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> where he run all about <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> and in the mean time, by means of his Fleet, hindred any thing from coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sea. He made himself Master of the Castle of <hi>Castillon</hi> in <hi>Medoc,</hi> which is three Leagues from <hi>Blaye,</hi> and the best Road of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and had there made further progress if <hi>Thoiras,</hi> whom the King had made Mareschal <hi>de Camp,</hi> and Colonel of the Regiment of <hi>Champeigne,</hi> had not hastned thither with that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and other Troops, which contrained him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbark, and took <hi>Castillon</hi> from him. A little while after, a furious Storm, having very much damaged his Fleet, forc'd him to retire to re-fit it.</p>
               <p>The Affairs of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were in no better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low Languedoc,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had made a great many of them take up Arms, because of the daily Incroachments on their Privileges, notwithstanding the reiterated Promises of the King, and his Declaration of the 25th. of <hi>January</hi> of that Year; by which, when he declar'd <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubise</hi> Rebels,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:187699:87"/> and those of their Party, he took into his Protection all who remain'd in quiet at home, under the benefit of his Edicts. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> having withdrawn himself to <hi>Castres,</hi> from whence he sent his Orders to all parts, the Parliament of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> Enemy to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> for a long time, made an Act, by which it ordain'd <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 30.</note>, that all the Jurisdiction, Secular and Ecclesiastical, Sub-Treasuries, and all Receipts, should be transferr'd from <hi>Castres</hi> to the City of <hi>Lautrec.</hi> The Mareschal <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> opposed themselves at the same time to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> with two little Bodies of an Army. The second attempted to block up <hi>Montauban</hi> with four Forts; he often beat the Garrison and the Inhabitants, and took their Movables from them. The first took from the Malecontents <hi>Bonail,</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Lamiatta,</hi> and divers other little Places <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 27.</note>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he beat the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> block'd him up in <hi>Viane,</hi> with the Troops which he had brought from <hi>Sevenes,</hi> and constrain'd him to retire by night. The same Duke intending to take the Castle of <hi>Sommieres,</hi> could not effect it, neither by surprize, nor by force, because it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by the <hi>Bailiff</hi> of <hi>Valencay,</hi> Governour of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier.</hi> These Disadvantages, and many others which I forbear to mention, oblig'd <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubise</hi> to send their Deputies to the Court, to make their Peace there. In effect, there was no probability they could make any longer resistance, because of the Division of their Party, and the greatest part of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> refusing to take up Arms. Besides, it was not possible for the Heads to be exactly obey'd, by People who might disobey without any peril: So that they must necessarily think of laying down their Arms; and they would never have taken them up again, if they had not by breach of Word been constrain'd to it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri, Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 5. p. 878.</note> had represented to the King, upon their Propositions, that whilst there was a Party on foot in his Kingdom, he could not undertake any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable abroad; and that he must first ruin this Party, before he engaged himself in such an Affair. Another perhaps would have judged, that this Party was that which could least embarass the Court: since the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> thought themselves always happy whilst the Edicts
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:187699:87"/> of <hi>Nants</hi> was observ'd, which diminish'd not the King's Revenues, and whose Observation acquir'd him the Love of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> ready to employ both their Blood and Goods for him, on any account, if he would make War with <hi>Spain.</hi> But the Cardinal, who lov'd Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power more than <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. because in effect he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd it more than he, would not suffer any one whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to implore the Succour of the Laws against his Will. It was therefore his Advice, that they should stand firm for the Affair of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> but he would not have the King come to an open breach with <hi>Spain.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, it being necessary to treat with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> that he might more advantageously do it with Foreigners, he believ'd, that in the present Conjuncture, it was good to make Peace with them, which many occasions would give opportunity to break, whenever it was thought fit.</p>
               <p>The principal Articles of the Peace were <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Rec.</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 879.</note>, That <hi>Fort-Louis</hi> should remain entire six Months after the <hi>Treaty;</hi> which being expir'd, it was to be demolish'd: That the <hi>Hugonots</hi> should yet for three Years enjoy the Places of Security remaining to them: That the building of some Forts, which they had begun about <hi>Montauban,</hi> should cease: That a summ of Money should be given to the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubise,</hi> for all their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, on condition this last should restore the six Vessels, which they had taken from the King at the beginning of the Year.</p>
               <p>They so much desired the conclusion of this Treaty, that they would not retard it farther, though they had an account two Days before the Subscription, that the Fleet of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had set fire to some of the King's Ships, burnt the Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and sunk three of their Vessels. There being a kind of Truce whilst the Treaty was negotiating, this Action of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> especially against the <hi>Holland</hi> Vessels, was generally disapprov'd. It was admired that the States-General, who were of the same Religion as the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and whose Interest it was to preserve this City, should send a Squadron to the King for to reduce it. But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interest more pressing, which was to keep their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with <hi>France,</hi> from which they were to have Six
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:187699:88"/> hundred thousand Crowns yearly, as long as they carried on the War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and which hindred that he fell not on them with all his Forces: This Interest, I say, made them act on this occasion contrary to their Inclination. Their Admiral <hi>Houtstein,</hi> though he had Orders to assist the King's Army, to reduce <hi>Soubise</hi> to his Obedience, did underhand make an Agreement with the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> to observe a kind of Neutrality between them, in reciprocally doing each other the least hurt they could. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> believing they could burn all the King's Fleet, and hinder them from making use of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships against them, broke their Word, and did them the damage just spoken of.</p>
               <p>This imprudent Action perfectly irritated the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral, and he disposed himself to revenge it the first opportunity, which fail'd not to present it self presently after. It seems the Treaty which was spoken of, was concluded, only to surprize <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubise,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them for some time. The War also was renew'd with more heat than before against the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> before the Legate departed from <hi>Paris.</hi> There came out of <hi>England</hi> seven great Vessels, which join'd the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and the Squadron of the States-General, and were Commanded by the Chevalier <hi>Rich,</hi> making in all Sixty in number, which the <hi>Rochellers</hi> were no way able to resist. Then the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> Great Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> came to the Coasts of <hi>Poictou,</hi> to Command that Fleet, which ruin'd the Designs of the <hi>Rochellers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before this Fleet put to Sea, <hi>Thoiras,</hi> Governour of <hi>Fort-Louis,</hi> had form'd a Design to throw himself into the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> whilst the King's Fleet should fight that of the Malecontents. He had sent a Gentleman to the Court to propose this Design, and to demand Forces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for it. They sent to him the Baron of St. <hi>Gery</hi> from the Court, to conferr with <hi>Thoiras,</hi> and see the Places, and whether the Measures which he proposed, were like to render the Enterprize successful. <hi>Gery</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving judg'd the Design well contriv'd, the Court order'd that <hi>Thoiras</hi> should have about Seventeen hundred Men, and Six Barques, with Fifty or Sixty Horse, to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Isle of <hi>Rhée.</hi> His Design was to follow the Naval Army, and to make a Descent on the Isle, whilst
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:187699:88"/> the <hi>Rochellers</hi> should be busied to defend themselves against the Fleet which went to attack them. Although <hi>Thoiras</hi> had conceived this Project, the Government of that Isle belonging to the Count <hi>de St. Luc,</hi> the general Command of the Troops which were to execute it, was given to him; and he brought with him a number of Voluntiers, who sought an opportunity to signalize themselves.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> embark'd himself, upon the Admiral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadron, in the Road of <hi>Olonne,</hi> and set sail the 15th of <hi>September,</hi> two hours after midnight, the Wind being favourable. All the Barques follow'd him, and sail'd towards the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> before which, in the Road of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> the <hi>Rochellers</hi> Fleet lay, consisting only of Twenty eight Vessels, and had no appearance of being able to engage Sixty; so it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to the <hi>Fosse de l▪Oye,</hi> as soon as the Navy-Royal appear'd. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> believ'd that their Enemies not knowing the Places as well as they, would perhaps run a-ground the Bank which lies at the entrance of the <hi>Fosse de l'Oye.</hi> But the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral contented himself with playing on them that Day with his Cannon, and to put himself into the Road of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> which the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had quitted. It was supposed that the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> chose to be in this Vessel, that he might the better oblige <hi>Houtstein</hi> to sight vigorously against the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> though the Duke in Compliment said, That he having no Experience in Sea-fights, was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyful to learn that Trade under so skilful a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Luc</hi> and <hi>Thoiras</hi> made the Descent the same day on the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> under the favour of some Vollies of Cannon (which were made on the Enemy, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd on the heighth of the Coast) by some Galliots. It was <hi>Soubise,</hi> who was at the head of Twelve hundred Foot, supported by an Hundred Horse, with Twenty four Pieces of Cannon; he discharged them several times upon the King's People, who landed in his sight; but whether he thought them more numerous than they were, or that he was terrified with the great number of the Men of War, who had moor'd themselves in the Road of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> he went away most shamefully, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:187699:89"/> left his Cannon behind him. The next Morning, <hi>St. Luc</hi> and <hi>Thoiras</hi> advancing towards the Town of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> perceiv'd <hi>Soubise,</hi> who came to meet them, with about Three thousand five hundred Men, and Four Pieces of Cannon, which marched before them. It seem'd so great a number would carry it; but the Militia of the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> disheartned in the Fight the day before, and perhaps ill Conducted, could not stand before the King's Forces. <hi>Soubise</hi> seeing them routed, fled with all speed to the Island of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> where a Challop waited for him, in which he retired to <hi>Oleron,</hi> and from thence, after the defeat of their Fleet, to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The next day the Fort of St. <hi>Martins</hi> surrender'd on Articles: So that the Army-Royal, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable loss, saw it self in two days Mistress of the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> defended by double the number of People. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Inconveniencies which attended those People who had taken up Arms against the King, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their Privileges, that their Heads could not help them; it is certain, that the greatest part of their Commanders were such as were more fit to make Pirates than to govern Armies, or to manage those Affairs which properly belong to the Care of a General. This was the cause, that though the People were very well affected to the Party, they never came to fight but they had the worst, let their number be what it would: Besides, the fear which their principal Heads, as <hi>Soubise,</hi> were in, of falling into the hands of the King's People, made them too cautious of themselves; so that as soon as they saw their Troops in any disorder, they thought of nothing but retiring, instead of endeavouring to rally them, and renew the Fight.</p>
               <p>Whilst St. <hi>Luc</hi> and <hi>Thoiras</hi> rendred themselves Masters of the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> beat several times the <hi>Rochelle</hi> Fleet, being forced to attend the Wind and Tide to come at them. He took nine Vessels, and extreamly endamaged the rest, which retreated to the Isle of <hi>Oleron.</hi> There were nevertheless three of the King's Ships which had fastned themselves to the Yard of one of the six which the <hi>Rochellers</hi> had taken at <hi>Blavet,</hi> by the Obstinacy of that Captain, were blown up with him, he chusing rather to set fire to the Powder, than to yield
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:187699:89"/> himself. A while after, the Isle of <hi>Oleron</hi> was reduced, with greater ease than that of <hi>Rhée:</hi> And the <hi>Rochellers</hi> seeing themselves despoiled of these Places, from whence they had the most part of their Provisions, because the Garrison of <hi>Fort-Lewis,</hi> prohibited them from getting any on the Land-side, began to think of nothing more than how to make their Peace with the Court.</p>
               <p>The Legat was yet at <hi>Paris,</hi> when the News of this Victory came thither; and though it did not trouble him to see the Hereticks brought down, yet he perceiv'd with regret, that now the Court was out of that trouble, it would every day grow more firm in the Affair of the <hi>Valteline.</hi> The Pope, on the other side, could not tell how to see it surrendred to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> lest they should settle <hi>Calvinism</hi> there, to which the greatest part of that People were addicted. The Count <hi>de Bethunes</hi> in vain represented to him, That it was better to hazard this Affair, than to kindle a War amongst the Catholicks. He brought him the Example of <hi>John</hi> I. who at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> went to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to oblige the Emperour <hi>Justin</hi> to restore to the <hi>Arrians</hi> their Churches, for fear lest <hi>Theodorick,</hi> who was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> should persecute the Orthodox in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope, not willing to agree to any thing on his side, and the <hi>French</hi> not knowing how to resolve to take away the Sovereignty from the <hi>Grisons,</hi> the Legate could make no conclusion. The Affair of <hi>Genoua</hi> also remain'd in the same state, without any prospect of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So the Legate resolv'd to return, and would have no further Conferences with the King's Ministers: He contented himself with speaking to them particularly by himself, or by the Nuncio and the Prelates of his Train. The Marquis <hi>de Mirabel</hi> complain'd of him, that the Legate would treat of a thing which concern'd the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> without ever taking Advice from its Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. The Legate answer'd to this, That he was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to consult their Minister at <hi>Paris;</hi> yet he had not been wanting to give him an account of what pass'd, by the Nuncio. Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> complain'd on his side of the Obstinacy of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and the other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of <hi>France,</hi> who would in no wise alter from the Propositions they had first made. The <hi>French</hi> also made
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:187699:90"/> their Complaints against the Legat, who in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion would propose nothing that was reasonable. They said they could not comprehend how the Pope could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to send his Nephew, without power from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to treat in his Name, without any assurance that the Marquis of <hi>Mirabel</hi> would meddle with this Negotiation, and without having first clear'd to himself how far they might in Conscience relax in regard to the Catholick Religion in the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not concern themselves in this Affair, because they had said from the beginning, that they would take no part, but what the security of the Catholick Religion in the <hi>Valteline</hi> might prompt them to, which was more the Pope's business than theirs. By that they should put the Pope in opposition to <hi>France,</hi> and the Scruples of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Maxims of State. In the Interim, the Troops which they had in the Forts of <hi>Fuentes</hi> and <hi>Riva,</hi> were in a condition to get the others, as soon as the <hi>French</hi> should abandon them. The Pope on his part, was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> appear'd not in it; because he hop'd that they would take the <hi>Valteline</hi> from the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> and give it to him, as they had declar'd: If that had been done <hi>Don Tadeo Barberini,</hi> or some other of his Family, had been presently invested.</p>
               <p>This made the <hi>French</hi> wish that this Affair might be treated directly with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Count <hi>d'Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez,</hi> first Minister of that Crown, was of the same Opinion: Were it that he desir'd Peace, as the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a new Treaty; or that he lov'd an open War rather than to remain any longer in Uncertainties. The affected Scruples of <hi>Ʋrban</hi> VIII. to render himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of what belong'd not to him, constrain'd at last the two Crowns to treat together about this Affair, without his Intervention, as the sequel will shew.</p>
               <p>Amongst the Articles which were drawn up in <hi>France,</hi> and many times corrected, to endeavour to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them to the Pope's Gusto, the second imported, That the Passes of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the neighbouring Counties, should remain open to <hi>France</hi> only as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And the fourth, That those of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and the two Counties of <hi>Brusch,</hi> and of <hi>Poschavio,</hi> as to what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:187699:90"/> appertain'd to the Administration of Justice amongst them, should be exempted from the Jurisdiction Civil and Criminal of the <hi>Grisons;</hi> That they should themselves chuse Judges and Governours to determine all sorts of Causes between private Persons and the Communities, without the <hi>Grisons</hi> putting themselves into it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Inhabitants of the <hi>Valteline</hi>'s pretending to make War, Peace, Alliances, to grant passage, coin Money, grant Favours; all which Rights should be reserv'd to the <hi>Grisons.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 15.</note> In the last Conference which the Legat had with the King's Ministers, it was discours'd much about these two Articles, and the Pope would absolutely have them reform'd; but <hi>France</hi> would no way allow an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. The <hi>French</hi> said, That what they had agreed for the security of the Catholick Religion in that Country, was more than those of the <hi>Valteline</hi> durst e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have hoped for. The Legat having no power to accept of these Articles as they were; and the <hi>French</hi> relaxing nothing, he shew'd himself very much griev'd that he could not accommodate those <hi>Brouilleries,</hi> until the Tears stood in his Eyes; and he threw, in despite, his Bonnet two or three times on the Table, as the Legat remonstrated, that the Pope, in Quality of Head of the Church, could not consent to have his Catholick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects remitted into the Hands of a Heretick Sovereign. The Cardinal told him, That his Holiness ought not to appear in the Treaty, but permit the <hi>Grisons</hi> and the Inhabitants of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to agree between themselves; and, in the sequel, to leave what should be done, as the Church had been accustom'd to do in things indifferent. The Legat replied, That his Holiness might accept of that Proposal, on condition they would first remit to him the Forts of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> to the end it might not be said, that the Catholicks of that Country were forc'd to treat with the <hi>Grisons.</hi> But the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal replied, with reason, That if there was any place for presumption, that this Treaty was made forceably; it was only the <hi>Grisons</hi> who had reason to complain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was they who relaxed their own Rights, in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of those of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> That it is apparent, that those who are Gainers by a Treaty, without suffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny disadvantage, cannot relieve themselves under pretence
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:187699:91"/> that it was done by force. And to shew that the Forts could not be remitted into the Hands of his Holiness, without speaking of their demolishment. The Cardinal demanded what security the Pope would give, that there might be a certainty that he would surrender the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of this Country to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> to which he would not consent, and the King would, at what price soever, that he should render it to them: If it should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the <hi>Grisons</hi> by a Treaty which they should make with those of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> What security should there be that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should be excluded out of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage? How can there be any assurance that they would demolish the Forts?</p>
               <p>Upon the first point the Legat answer'd, That his Holiness would not hinder the Inhabitants of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline</hi> to condescend (for so he worded it) to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sovereignty of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and that there was no doubt but they were free to it. Upon the second he said, That the Pope had the Word of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> That provided they would remit the Forts into his Hands, they would consent to what the <hi>French</hi> demanded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Passage. The Cardinal replied, That it must be had in writing. And the Legat replied, That he had it not, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not declare themselves, before the Forts were in the Hands of the Pope, but he was most assur'd of it. For the third point the Legat said, That the Pope promis'd to do what <hi>France</hi> desir'd: But the Cardinal replied, That in matter of Treaties, there was to be real Security, and that nothing had been offer'd but uncertain Words; That if a thing were in agitation, which depended on his Holiness, the King would entirely confide in his Word; but the Inhabitants of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and more especially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> accustom'd to violate their Faith given, might hinder his Holiness to execute what he had promis'd. The Legat said, That could never be; but if it should happen against the Intention of the Pope, he would surrender the Forts neither to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> nor the <hi>French,</hi> but keep them. Upon this the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal propos'd to him this other Question; Whether he believ'd, that the King, who was in League with the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:187699:91"/> that the <hi>Grisons</hi> should be re-establish'd in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authority, ought, after he had been at infinite Charges to bring it about, to put things in the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he found them, or to leave them in an Estate far worse? He added, That this was just what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, since for security they gave only the Pope's Word; the execution of which depended on the Inhabitants of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who would be glad to spin out a thing in length, as they had hitherto done, and who would make the Catholicks of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> who acted nothing but by their Motion, do whatever they should think fit; That if those of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should forfeit their Word to the Pope, he knew very well that he might take Vengeance; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his being mortal (for as to Expedients, in case that should happen, nothing was propos'd but the keeping of Forts, which was a Remedy as bad as the Disease, since the <hi>Grisons</hi> would still find themselves spoil'd of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which belong'd to them) the Cardinal represented farther to the Legat, That for one imaginary Scruple they were about to set all <hi>Europe</hi> into a Flame. To which the Legat replied, That if their wanted his Blood only to extinguish it, he would shed it most willingly, but he had not any power to advance other Propositions. The Cardinal demanded presently of <hi>Spada,</hi> and <hi>Azzolini,</hi> who were present, Whether they would advise the King's Ministers, to run the Risques propos'd to him? They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously answer'd, No. But the King might well frame this Design himself, although no Minister ought to be so bold as to take the Charge of Events on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>After this Conference the Legat spoke of nothing but of departing; and the 22d of <hi>September</hi> he had his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Conge,</hi> and without Ceremony departed on the 24th. After he had taken leave of the King once more, but in private, as Cardinal <hi>Barberin,</hi> and not in Quality of Legat. Having after a manner bid adieu, he took his Coach, without having his Dispatches, and saying nothing where he would lodge. The King, who would have defray'd his Charges, as he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from his Entrance into the Realm, was vex'd, and sent Orders for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treated every where, as had been done unto his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:187699:92"/> The Nuncio <hi>Spada</hi> excus'd him upon this, that he would avoid all sorts of Ceremonies; but the true Reason of his so sudden departure was, because he would not be at the Court in the time, when they were to make at <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> an Assembly of Notables, to treat of the Measures which were to be taken in these present Conjunctures. It was easie to foresee, that there they would infinitely extol the Conduct of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and blame that of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> in which case it was not beseeming for the Legat to stay any longer in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although they would not as yet grant him any thing, yet would they have been glad he had stay'd longer at the Court, to see in the mean time, what Train the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Italy</hi> would take, and afterwards to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to it. He was told by the Fathers, <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Berule,</hi> That if he would stay, he should have the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to see, that the King, in consideration of him, instead of the Peace which he had given to the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> some Weeks before, would make War upon them with greater vigour than ever; That there would be a Council of Notables held, where none of those of the Parliament would be opposite to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and where perhaps something would be resolv'd, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to his Negotiation; That, in fine, there might well be a suspension of Arms between the two Crowns. The Legat regarded not all this; and <hi>Spada</hi> excus'd him very well, in saying, that there was nothing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Legat of what the King did, if having beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> he had made use of the advantage which he had, to pull that Thorn out of his Foot; That the Assembly of Notables was not to give the King Counsel, but to authorise that which his Ministers had given him; That for the suspension of Arms, it was perhaps the Estate in which the Affairs of the Crown in <hi>Italy</hi> were, which caus'd it to be spoken of. But then, it must be demanded of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who would not have it. and not of <hi>France,</hi> which perhaps might have need of it, and sought it only to gain time to send Succours into <hi>Pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>t;</hi> after which, if she had any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, she would speak in quite another Tone, as she had been accustom'd to do in Prosperity.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:187699:92"/>
               <p> These and such like Discourses, which <hi>Spada</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times held, had rendred him odious to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> for almost a Year before the departure of the Legat. In the Conferences which he had had with the Cardinal, he had more than once piqued that Minister, who was accus'd to be proud, subject to Choler, and revengeful, now only by speaking to him, as to a Counsellor of the King, but taking him in his proper person. One day when they were much heated, <hi>Spada</hi> threatned the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, with the indignation of the Pope; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal jeering, ask'd him what the Pope would do to him: <hi>Spada</hi> replied, he would take away the Hat which he had given him. The Cardinal, more vers'd in things present than in the Histories of times past, reparteed, It was a thing without Example; and <hi>Spada</hi> replied, That Histories were full of it. This Quarrel gave the the Cardinal an aversion for the Nuncio, whose Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations became afterwards more difficult.</p>
               <p>Presently after the Legat's departure, an Assembly of Notables <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 19.</note> was summon'd at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> in presence of the King, the Queen-Mother, and the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans;</hi> it was compos'd of four Cardinals, of Archbishops and Bishops, Deputies of the Clergy; the Dukes of <hi>Nemours,</hi> of <hi>Longueville,</hi> and of <hi>Chevreuse,</hi> of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council; the Secretaries of State, the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and Intendants of the Finances, the Presidents and Officers of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Mareschals <hi>de Bassompierre, de Schomberg, d'Aubeterre,</hi> and other Officers of the Crown, convocated by express Order of the King. Although the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs of Peace and War, take those Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which please them best, without communicating to their Ministers what they think necessary, this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is convened to treat of an Affair which may concern partly the State, and partly Religion. The Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> had engag'd the King to this, to discharge upon those which compos'd it, the hatred which his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viers had endeavour'd to draw on him, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that he had advis'd the King to unite himself with divers Protestant Powers against the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.</hi> They particularly accus'd him with giving Peace to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and protecting the <hi>Calvinist Grisons</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:187699:93"/> against the Catholick Inhabitants of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> as if the Good of the State had not requir'd it.</p>
               <p>The King and the Queen-Mother being sat, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. p. 24.</note> and the others standing, the King told the Assembly, That the Chancellor should tell them wherefore he had assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them: And the Chancellor taking the Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the Alliances and the Treaties which the Crown had with the <hi>Grisons;</hi> and after, inform'd them of what had pass'd in relation to the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and the Propositions which the Legat had made, remitting the more particular Circumstances to what the Mareschal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> should say. He afterwards fell upon the departure of the Legat, who had given several Marks of his being discontented, although they had done him all imaginable Honours, and had endeavour'd to stay him a little longer, In fine, he enlarg'd to demonstrate the falsity of that Proposition, which some Divines of <hi>Italy</hi> had maintain'd, <hi>That it was not permitted to Catholicks to restore Lands to Hereticks,</hi> by drawing from thence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Consequences, which might arise in respect of Secular Princes. The Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> proceeded on the Chancellor's Discourse, more to declare his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, than to expound the Affairs then in Transaction. He complain'd of the great variation he had observ'd in the manner of the Legat's negotiating, and of the other Ministers of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had only spoken of the restitution of the Forts of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and at last had yet left it undetermin'd. He added also, That they would not at all declare, whether they had power from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to treat in their Name, or not: That being press'd thereto, they said, That they had in their Hands wherewith to satisfie the King; and in the Sum of the account, they confess'd that they had not any Power in behalf of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> That at other times they had said, That <hi>Bormio</hi> might be surrendred by the <hi>Grisons;</hi> and that at present they would not leave them any Marks of Sovereignty. In fine, his opinion was, that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were to be rejected. The Queen-Mother thereupon said something in praise of the Legat, as loving Peace, and being well inclin'd to <hi>France.</hi> After which there was so long a silence, that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor was oblig'd to say, That if there were any one
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:187699:93"/> in that Assembly who had any good Counsel to give about the matters which were then in debate, the King permitted him to do it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis</hi> took upon him to say, That the Pope might complain of this; That at the beginning of his Pontificate, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took him for a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> and that at present the <hi>French</hi> complain'd that he was a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> He exhorted the King to use his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to gain him; and added, That he saw no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Expedient to accommodate the difference between the two Crowns, than a suspension of Arms; That Peace was to be preferr'd to War, provided it was Honourable; but in case it could not that way be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, they were to obtain their Rights by Arms, after they had convinc'd all the World of the Justice of their Cause. In fine, his opinion was for Peace, such as the Pope desir'd; that is to say, by remitting the <hi>Valteline</hi> to him; in which his Holiness demanded nothing, in his Judgment, but what was conformable to the Head of the Church, and in which his Majesty would do nothing but what was requisite for its eldest Son.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> being disturb'd at what he said, and not being willing to speak in publick, that Day, had at the beginning withdrawn out of the Ring, and seated himself on a Bench against the Wall, with Monsieur and the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette.</hi> But when he saw the Cardinal <hi>de Soudis</hi> begin, he drew near, and by his Gestures shew'd, that he disapprov'd his Opinion, and particularly the suspension of Arms. Also as soon as he had given over speaking, he took the Word, and began to say, That although his Profession rendred him partial, since the Transaction was, whether War or Peace; yet the Reputation of his Majesty oblig'd him to speak freely his Sentiments. He after this praised Peace, and said, That his Majesty was oblig'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as much as possibly he could do, to procure it with Honour. One would have thought that what he intended to say, by this beginning, was to counsel the King to the same things which he who spoke before him had done, but his conclusion was quite contrary; That he saw not how the King could honourably make
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:187699:94"/> Peace in the present Conjunctures; That the Duty of a King, and the Title of <hi>Most Christian,</hi> were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible, and ought not to be separated; That as by his Quality of <hi>Most Christian,</hi> the King ought to have care of the Catholick Religion, and those who made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it in the <hi>Valteline;</hi> so in his Quality of King, he ought not to neglect his Reputation, nor the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of his States, or those of his Allies, nor regard it as a thing indifferent, to be consider'd as a Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Honour, without Power, and without Faith; That for to get out with Honour, he must resolve on a long War, and that way preserve to <hi>France</hi> the Passage by the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and to the <hi>Grisons</hi> their Sovereignty; That if <hi>France</hi> abandon'd her Allies, she would not find in the sequel any support amongst her Neighbours, who would be sure to quit her, to unite themselves with <hi>Spain;</hi> That presently, when the neighbouring Potentates should behold the King full of Constancy and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they would be for him, and would never forsake him, whilst he should persist in that Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That Honour was the true Patrimony of Kings; and that his Majesty ought to hazard all to preserve his; That the King's Treasures were in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good condition, since his Superintendents assur'd him, that they had wherewithal to pay four Musters; that is to say, eight Months Pay for the Troops on foot, and the Levies which were to be made, without touching the Capital, or having recourse to extraordinary ways, or anticipating the next Year; That the Affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> began to grow worse in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that their Army was extreamly diminished; That the Victory which the King had obtain'd over the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> assur'd the quiet of the Kingdom, and gave place to hope, that they would in a short time be reduc'd to their Duty. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded after this, as if every body was of his mind, and the majority of Votes conformable to his; That a Courier must be expedited to the Legat, to let him know, that the Assembly was of the same Sentiments with the Cabinet Council: But the King would not give over to hear Propositions of Peace, which might be compatible with his Reputation; and if they would not do it, his Armies, who had met so happy beginnings, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:187699:94"/> their first vigour, though in the Summer they had been somewhat diminished.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> thereupon said, That he was at <hi>Rome</hi> when the Pope establish'd a Congregation of Divines, to know how far he might relax his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science touching the Affair of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and if he might remit Catholick Inhabitants of that Country, under the Domination of the <hi>Grisons;</hi> and that the Divines had answer'd, That he might, and ought to do it, because Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion no way authoris'd Injustice. As to the rest, he was of the same opinion with Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Premier President spoke after him, and said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but that so wise a Prince, assisted by Counsellors of the highest Prudence, had no need of his Counsel, nor of any whatsoever; so that he had nothing to do but to command, that it was his Duty to obey, which he offered in the Name of all the Parliament.</p>
               <p>After this, no person speaking a Word more, the King rose up, without taking any Resolution in publick, and dismiss'd the Assembly. But the Advice of the Cardinal was put in execution; and Couriers were sent, not only to the Pope and the Legat, but also to the Ambassadors of the Crown, to inform them of what had pass'd. They wrote particularly to the Count <hi>du Fargis,</hi> Ambassador in <hi>Spain,</hi> That the difficulty of all this Negotiation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the King's not having immediately treated by their Ministers, the Pope not being able to resolve on that which a Secular Prince would have easily done: Wherefore Orders were given to him, to see if the Count <hi>d'Olivarez,</hi> who had shew'd some Desires of Peace, would make no overture to him to surmount this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
               <p>The Negotiation of the Legat having been at last di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by his Ambassador, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>A little time after <note n="*" place="margin">About the middle of <hi>Novemb. ibid.</hi> p. 384.</note> the <hi>Rochellers</hi> sent their Deputies to the Court to endeavour a Peace. They had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to obtain Audience of the King: But the Constable having wrote very urgently to the King to induce him to grant a Peace, that he might be in a better condition to make War abroad, it was resolv'd to hear them, and to keep them in expectation as long as they could, to see if before the conclusion of a Peace with them, there might an accomodation be made with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Deputies having thrown themselves at the King's Feet, began to shew much grief, for their having taken up Arms against him; and without undertaking to justifie themselves, they begg'd his pardon, in most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive Terms, to move him to pity, and supplicated him to grant them Peace. The King answer'd them, That they had behav'd themselves very ill, and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently towards him, but he would pardon them, and grant them Peace on the Conditions which the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor should tell them.</p>
               <p>These Conditions were, I. <q>That the Council and the Government of <hi>Rochel</hi> should be put into the Hands of those of the Body of the City, as it was in the Year 1610.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <q>That it should receive a Superintendant of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to hinder the Differences and Partialities which might happen in the City, to administer Justice there, and settle Trade.</q>

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:187699:95"/> III. <q>That all the Fortifications should be demolish'd, and the City reduc'd to the ancient Circuit, such as it was in the year 1560.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <q>That his Majesty should be receiv'd there with the Respect due to him, at all times that it should please him to give them the Honour of visiting them.</q>

               <p n="5">V. <q>That the <hi>Rochellers</hi> should not keep in their Port any Vessels of War; and that all others destin'd for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, or Mercandize, should have the Admiral's leave, as was practis'd in other places in the Kingdom, and should not depart out of the Port before eight days no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given to the Intendent of Justice.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <q>That all Goods belonging to the Ecclesiasticks should be restor'd, as well as the Carts, Horses, and Merchandize of some Merchants of <hi>Orleans.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. <q>That as to the rest, it was the King's Pleasure that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> should fully and peaceably enjoy all their priviledges of freedom of Trade and of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of <hi>Nantz.</hi>

               <p>The Deputies, after they had receiv'd these Articles, carried them to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> to advise what Answer should be return'd thereto. In the mean time that City was kept blockt up as before; and the Mareschal <hi>de Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> was nam'd General of the Army which oppos'd the Incursions of the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> Divers vigorous Sallies were made, and many Rencounters, wherein sometime the King's People, and sometimes the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> had the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ʋrban</hi> VIII. was resolv'd long since to send the same Cardinal into <hi>Spain</hi> which had been in <hi>France,</hi> to try if he could obtain that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which he could not from the <hi>French:</hi> But he was to make some stay at <hi>Rome</hi> before he went for <hi>Madrid,</hi> for fear the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should be displeas'd and complain, That the Pope had given the preference to the most Christian King, if the Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> had gone immediately from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> In the Interim, the Pope gave Orders to <hi>Spada</hi> to renew the Negotiation with the King's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. For this end, having gone to see the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu;</hi> and having begun to discourse of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which had been so long talked of, the Cardinal told him, That it was a Game where they might play
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:187699:96"/> with few Men, since all was reduc'd to three Points; The Interest of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> That of the King, and That of the Allies. For the first point, the Cardinal said, That without obliging himself to any thing he would declare frankly to the Nuncio his Opinion; which was, that a Restoration must be made to the <hi>Grisons</hi> of the Sovereignty of the Country, as had been formerly agreed. As to the second, he judg'd, that way was to be found to secure that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should no more have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Passage through the <hi>Valteline.</hi> All the difficulty of the third, consisted in satisfying the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> not as that Prince imagin'd he ought to be, but according to the Rules of Equity.</p>
               <p>The Nuncio made some Reflections on the first and second of these Articles, but fix'd on nothing, for fear he should extort some angry Answer from the Cardinal, who had retain'd himself in Generalities. Afterwards the Cardinal told him, That he would root out the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> but first he must of necessity once more scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize the World. The Nuncio replied, That if he could do good without first doing evil, it would be much more to his Glory; and that the evil depending only on our selves, and the good on others, as well as the evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the first were present and certain, and the Benefit expected, hid in futurity, and little assur'd. <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> compris'd in this, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri, Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. p. 33.</note> That the Cardinal had a design to make Peace with the <hi>Hugonots</hi> and lull them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, and then destroy them; and that so he had the same end with those which spoke against Peace with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> that is to say, their ruin.</p>
               <p>After this the Cardinal fell on boasting, That he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd all with going, only three times in a Week to the <hi>Louvre;</hi> although that was sufficiently troublesom to him. He added, That the King was every day more kind to him, and excited him to ask new Favours, but that he had told him he would have but one, but so great, that perhaps his Majesty might think it strange, which was to have a place in the History of his Reign; but he would not have it, except at the same time his Majesty acquir'd a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>They afterwards fell back upon the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> and the Nuncio, after divers Reflections, said,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:187699:96"/> That to discover the secret of the Affair, it must needs be that the Cardinal must think of satisfying the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> or the Pope, so as he might shut the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Mouths; and that could never be, without disengaging those of the <hi>Valteline</hi> from the Sovereignty of the <hi>Grisons;</hi> without which the Pope could not joyn with the King of <hi>France</hi> to appease the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Cardinal shew'd, that he was oblig'd to the Nuncio that he put confidence in him; and added, That it would be very difficult, though not impossible, to obtain of the Council the ratification of those Articles which had been propos'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning the Religion of those of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> and that he despair'd not at all, but that they might consent to give them a Catholick Governour, and one of that Country, but then he must be named by the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> That for the restitution of the Forts to the Pope, It was a thing extreamly delicate, not only for the <hi>French,</hi> who since four Years had not ceas'd to complain of those Fortifications, but also for their Allies; and that neither the one nor the other would after so many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, so great Expences and Dangers which they had been at, to render themselves Masters of what they held, restore them on the Word of the Pope, since a thousand things might happen, to delay or hinder the demolition of the Forts; and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might intermeddle or work their own advantage by it; That nevertheless, the Overture of the Nuncio was founded upon Equity, there might be some means thought of to satisfie the Pope, and make the demolition certain; as to keep Troops on the Frontiers of <hi>Avignon;</hi> under which pretext the County of <hi>Avignon,</hi> might be as a Pledge for the observation of the Treaty. The Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio replied, It would be sufficient for that, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate should remain during that time in <hi>France.</hi> That might be a thing to be consider'd, replied the Cardinal, provided the Pope declar'd by a Letter, that he left him there as an Hostage. The Nuncio having rejected that Proposition, they came to the third Article; and the Cardinal said, That there was no talking after any fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of giving any satisfaction to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wronging either the Reputation or Interest of the most Christian King; and that it was easier to abandon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:187699:97"/> the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as <hi>Spain</hi> had desir'd, without saying any thing, than to promise it either by word of Mouth, or writing. For what regarded the Sovereignty of the <hi>Grisons</hi> over the <hi>Valteline;</hi> That he was a Divine as well as others, and that he knew that they might be left there in all security of Conscience.</p>
               <p>At the end of this Year <hi>Miron,</hi> the King's Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in Ordinary with the <hi>Swiss Cantons;</hi> and all those which did the Affairs of the Crown amongst those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did write, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mem. de Bassomp.</hi> T. 2. p. 335.</note> That their Affection towards the King was extreamly alter'd; That more than twenty five thousand <hi>Germans</hi> had had open Passage through <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> to go and serve the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> That the Alliance of the <hi>Swissers</hi> was insensibly coming to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if timely care was not taken; That the chiefest means of retrieval was to send the Mareschal <hi>de Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre</hi> to the <hi>Cantons,</hi> who was Colonel of the <hi>Swiss</hi> Troops in <hi>France,</hi> because the <hi>Swissers</hi> had a great esteem for him. The <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made the same Proposals to engage the King to send him; insomuch that it was concluded he should go. He departed as Ambassador Extraordinary <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 18.</note> some time after; and at his Arrival, the <hi>Cantons Schwitz</hi> of <hi>Ʋri</hi> and <hi>Zuy,</hi> sent him Declarations; by which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to stop the Passages to all Potentates who should not approve of the Rendition of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to the <hi>Grisons;</hi> and the other <hi>Cantons</hi> prepar'd to do the same. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> against whom this was, drew themselves out of the Affair, by saying they would declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereupon, when the Forts should be in the hands of the Pope.</p>
               <p>Some Weeks after that, the Mareschal <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> parted for <hi>Swisserland,</hi> the Court sent <hi>Blainville</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> in Quality of Ambassador Extraordinary, to complain of the Breaches which the new King <hi>Charles</hi> (for King <hi>James</hi> was dead sometime before the Queen pass'd over Sea) had made in the Matrimonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <note place="margin">
                     <hi>April</hi> 6.</note> concluded in <hi>France.</hi> Scarcely was the Queen his Spouse arriv'd at <hi>London,</hi> and the Articles of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract publish'd among the <hi>English;</hi> but almost all the Protestant people took the Alarm, as if this Marriage had been only made to introduce the Catholick Religion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:187699:97"/> in <hi>England.</hi> In effect, the King had agreed to so many things, in favour of the Queen's <hi>French</hi> Domesticks, and the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks, and taken so little care for the Education of his Children, which might be born of this Marriage, in the Protestant Religion, that unless he was resolv'd to break his Word, the Articles of the Contract were to be look'd on as a design to strengthen the Catholick Party in <hi>England,</hi> which could not be done without diminishing the force of that of the Protestants. Perhaps King <hi>James</hi> irritated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who had been very troublesom to him as well as to his Mother, was willing to frame a Party more opposite to them than the <hi>English</hi> Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were. Perhaps he thought to be absolute Master of the Laws, by introducing a division amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who by that means would no longer be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend their Priviledges. Let it be as it will, it is certain, that he and his Son gave opportunity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they should not be angry to see the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks powerful in <hi>England.</hi> It was also complain'd of that they were engag'd in a thing which was not in their power to relax; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> against the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, establish'd by many Acts of Parliament. So the King, urged on by the Parliament, held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and by the general Complaints of the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation, was oblig'd in regard to them, to act quite contrary to what he had promis'd. This the King understood by the Duke of <hi>Chevreuse</hi>'s return, who had accompany▪d the Queen unto <hi>London,</hi> of <hi>Ville-aux-clers,</hi> and of <hi>D'Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiat,</hi> Extraordinary Ambassadors, aad by the Letters of the Bishop of <hi>Mande,</hi> of Father <hi>Berule,</hi> and many others. Besides <hi>Charles</hi>'s Indulgence to the Catholicks, the <hi>French,</hi> Priests which were in <hi>England,</hi> more in Quality of Missionaries than Domesticks to the Queen, had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with them the Spirit of Mission; which is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to intrigue themselves in all Affairs as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and to make a great bustle, because the more a Missionary makes himself to be talk'd of, the greater is his Recompence at the return of the Mission. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion of these people, who fansied themselves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready possess'd of the best Benefices of <hi>England,</hi> caus'd great disorder at Court, and begun to draw upon the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:187699:98"/> King a Party which at last ruin'd him, without any advantage to the Catholick Religion; on the contrary, it had been ruin'd by him, had not the Sons, who had the same Designs as the Father, endeavour'd its restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will go no further into the <hi>Brouilleries</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It may be enough to tell you, that the Court of <hi>France,</hi> by maintaining the Queen, as much as possible endeavour'd to avoid a War with <hi>England,</hi> which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless it could not put off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soubise,</hi> who was in <hi>England,</hi> was in truth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at Court; but the King notwithstanding durst not command him to depart the Kingdom, for fear of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Protestant People, who already murmured with reason, that contrary to all Interest of Policy and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the King had sent seven Vessels against the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi> It had been said, That it was the Interest of <hi>Charles</hi> to aid the King of <hi>France,</hi> to become absolute Master at home, and to destroy <hi>Calvinism;</hi> whilst the Council of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. judged, that good Policy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that <hi>France</hi> should manage things quite contrary in respect of <hi>England,</hi> where it endeavour'd as much as possible to settle the Catholick Religion, and there form a Party, which must needs be troublesome to a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant King. The <hi>English,</hi> who were persuaded that the Policy of the <hi>French</hi> was better than that of their own King, obliged him presently to act otherwise in respect of the <hi>Rochellers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He said <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. See <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. p. 69.</note>, That it could never be imagined that one should think him so ill-natur'd, as to forsake his Kinsman in affliction, reduced to the last necessity of the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as he, and particularly belov'd of his People: That he had hoped, that they would have brought him Thanks in behalf of the most Christian King, because he would never receive <hi>Soubise</hi> at the Court, but only suffer'd his Ships not to be driven out of the Ports of <hi>England;</hi> that in truth he thought it not fit they should go out to make Courses on the <hi>French.</hi> But the most Christian King would also do well to grant Peace to his Subjects, that he might be the better enabled to act against his Enemies: That <hi>Henry</hi> IV. his Father had given refuge in <hi>France</hi> to the Count of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> who had made an attempt on the Person of his Father King
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:187699:98"/>
                  <hi>James;</hi> and had made this excuse, That all the Kings of the World had right to give Sanctuary to whom they pleased. <hi>Blainville</hi> replied, That he very well knew, that as to the rigour, he might give retreat to <hi>Soubise;</hi> but he ought also to think, that <hi>France</hi> might one day give him the same Vexation, and perhaps on more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occasions; but if his Majesty would live ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably with a great King who was his Brother-in-Law, he would have many things to say, in contradiction to this Proceeding: That nevertheless if he took so much part as to the Person of <hi>Soubise,</hi> he would speak no more of it; but he would not do the same in respect of the Ships, which for the most part belong'd to the King, or to his Subjects, from whom <hi>Soubise</hi> had taken them; and he demanded their restitution, or the King would cause them to be taken where-ever he found them.</p>
               <p>Much different from hearing these Complaints and Threats, the King of <hi>England</hi> re-demanded his Ships of the King of <hi>France;</hi> and they not restoring them, he caused several <hi>French</hi> Vessels which were in the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> to be arrested. In the mean time, the <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> who perceived by the Conditions which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them, that they intended to deprive them of their Privileges; and to put them out of condition to resent it, had sent Deputies to <hi>London</hi> to demand Succours, in case the Wars should continue. They receiv'd <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 22▪</note> good entertainment from the Privy-Council; and in effect Orders were given to put a part of the Fleet in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>During this, not to make too brisk a Breach with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1626"/>
                  <hi>French,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> sent two Ambassadors to <hi>Paris, viz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Carleton,</hi> to induce that King to make a League with <hi>England,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment of the Elector <hi>Palatine:</hi> They had also Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to endeavour to procure Peace to the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and to re-demand of that King the Ships of War which were lent him the Year before. They demanded these <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 24.</note> three things at their first Audience; and the King answered as to the first, That he had Reasons not to make any such League; but perhaps he would cause the Elector to be restor'd without it. To the second he said, That if the <hi>Rochellers</hi> would return to their Duty, he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:187699:99"/> them Peace; but he would not engage to treat about it with any one whatsoever, and that they ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from his sole Bounty. As to the Vessels, the King declar'd that he was ready to restore one Ship of War belonging to his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> but the six others being Merchant Ships armed for War, he could not be oblig'd to return them, whilst he had occasion for them, since he would not have asked them but for that use, and that he had made a Contract for them.</p>
               <p>In speaking concerning the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> the Ambassadors had said, That they had not any League with them; and if they demanded Peace for them, it was as Friends of <hi>France,</hi> and because they desired all their Forces might be employ'd against the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Notwithstanding <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 30.</note> but a little after, the Council of <hi>England</hi> resolv'd on three things, very opposite to the Designs of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. The first was openly to assist <hi>Rochelle;</hi> the second, to re-call the Ambassadors from <hi>France;</hi> and the third, to send the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> for this Expedition, which was to be authoriz'd by Act of Parliament. <hi>Buckingham</hi> at that time said to <hi>Blainville,</hi> That he was troubled to see the Two Crowns embroil'd in such a manner, as that he must lose the fruit of all the Services he had done to <hi>France,</hi> and found himself in danger to give account of his Actions to the Parliament: That the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had helped to ruin <hi>Soubise,</hi> out of the sole Affection which he had to the <hi>French</hi> King, and thinking that he would content himself with the punishment of one rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Subject: But now he saw that they labour'd wholly to extirpate those of his Religion, he could no longer stand neuter, without incurring the blame of all the World; and that all his People, and all his Council, would oblige him with common Consent to undertake their Defence. <hi>Buckingham</hi> added to this, That <hi>France</hi> exposed its Allies to great danger by this Conduct; and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would certainly take advantage by these Divisions. He further said, That if the War should break out between the Two Crowns, the Queen and her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks would suffer much, without possibility to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>The King advertised of this Disposition of the <hi>English,</hi> and fearing a Rupture from <hi>Spain,</hi> was resolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:187699:99"/> with the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> They had sent their Deputies to <hi>Paris</hi> at the beginning of the Year; but they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought the Ratification of the Articles, which they had put into their hands in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> the King would not see them, but left them to the Mareschal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> who had Orders to hear them. They had offer'd to reform their Magistracy, as had been given to understand it was required; but they would hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an Intendant of Justice. For their Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they would rase only those which were made since the Year 1621. and on condition that <hi>Fort-Lewis</hi> should also be demolish'd, and those which were begun in the Isles of <hi>Rhée</hi> and <hi>Oleron.</hi> There appear'd no more, in the Discourses and Manners of the Deputies, that fear which they seem'd to be in, after the Defeat in the Month of <hi>September.</hi> The Threats which were made to them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed them not much, were it that they expected fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Succours, as they had been promised from <hi>England,</hi> or that they hoped that the rest of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> would take Arms. In effect, those of the <hi>Vivarez</hi> surpriz'd <hi>Pousin,</hi> a small Place on the <hi>Rhonse,</hi> from whence they made Incursions on the Neighbourhood, and extreamly incommoded the Carriages which were made over that <hi>River;</hi> but the Constable <hi>de Lesdigueres</hi> re-took it soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal was not a little disappointed in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, because he desired two very difficult things; one was Peace at home; the other, that the Interests and Reputation of the State should be so well maintain'd abroad, that no Weakness might appear. Had he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed much for the foreign Interests, he had not been well assur'd of a domestick Peace. The <hi>Hugonots</hi> were not the most to be fear'd, because the Observation of the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> would easily appease them: But he found a most powerful Party of the Catholicks to rise against him, whom the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> whom the Ministers, after he had estranged himself from Court, would not suffer to return, might serve to head. The People envied much the Authority of the Cardinal; and being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to depend upon him, had a plausible pretext to raise the Catholicks, zealous against him as a Favourer of Hereticks, a Crime wherewith they already made a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:187699:100"/> great noise in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This, if Peace should be made with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which yet was necessary in the Disposition in which <hi>England</hi> then stood, might be said properly to cheat the Catholick People, and to raise those who were inflam'd with Zeal for the extirpation of Hereticks, who had caused so many Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in the World, that by a pernicious piece of Policy, the Cardinal had omitted the Opportunity to take <hi>Rochelle;</hi> the only Rampart of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and <hi>Assylum</hi> of all the Enemies of the Crown.</p>
               <p>Before advice came of the Inclinations of the Council of <hi>England,</hi> the Court had very ill treated the Deputies of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Schomberg</hi> told them, That if the King used them as he ought, he would cause them to be hanged. They were thereupon upon the point of retiring; but they order'd matters so, as made them attend some days; and the Duke <hi>de la Trimoüille</hi> having wrote to his Brother the Count <hi>de Laval,</hi> who was in <hi>Rochelle,</hi> to propose for himself more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Articles than the former. In fine, as there had been yet no Overture to accommodate the foreign Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and <hi>England</hi> busying it self in favour of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> it was judged of necessity to make a Peace with them: It was concluded and signed the 5th. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary;</hi> and the Articles run in these terms:</p>
               <p>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Sequel of the Rebellion of <hi>France,</hi> p. 438.</note> The King being desirous to give Peace to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which were of the pretended <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in the City of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> which they requested of him with all instances of Submission and Respect, granted it to them on the following Conditions:</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <q>That the Council and Government of <hi>Rochelle</hi> shall be put and establish'd in the hands of those who are of the Body of that City, in the form they were in, in the Year 1610.</q>

               <p n="2">II. <q>That they shall receive a Commissary, to cause those things to be executed which shall be order'd by the Peace, and to stay there during his Majesty's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</q>

               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <q>That because his Majesty cannot agree to the rasing of <hi>Fort-Lewis,</hi> which those of <hi>Rochelle</hi> require; he promises, out of his Bounty, to cause such Orders to be establish'd in the Garrisons which he shall please to leave in the said Fort, as also in the Isles of <hi>Rhée</hi> and <hi>Oleron,</hi> that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> shall not receive any trouble or impediment in the security and liberty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which they shall make according to the Laws, Orders, and Customs of the Kingdom, nor in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Goods, and gathering the Fruits they shall have in those Isles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When these Articles were to be signed, the Cardinals of <hi>Richlieu</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucaud</hi> went out of the Council, that they might not appear too publickly to consent to any Truce with the Hereticks, though the first had been strongly opinionated in favour of the Peace.</p>
               <p>To conclude more firmly the appeasing of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> the King publish'd an Edict in the Month of <hi>March;</hi>

                  </note> They publish'd a number of Latin Libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, to defame him throughout all <hi>Europe;</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris</hi> condemn'd some of them; and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal wanted not those who wrote in his behalf; but the best answer which could be given, had been to discover the true Intentions of the Cardinal, such as were taken notice of before, <hi>pag.</hi> 265. But this was not then done, because it was not the intent to let the <hi>Hugonots</hi> know they were cheated; Time sufficiently shewed it: And after the Year 1628. there was no Person who accused this Prelate of being favourable to the Hereticks. These Libels came from People who had no less Vanity and Ambition than he; and who would not have spoken ill of him, but because they envied his Post, but knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Affairs of State. The small Capacity of those who have oftentimes undertook to defame him, compared with his Management, had so advantageous Effects for him, that he never appear'd a Person of more Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, than when they undertook to censur his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>To pass on presently to other things, which happen'd about the commencement of the Year 1626. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>de Bassompierre,</hi> after he had disposed the Spirits of the <hi>Swissers</hi> to agree to what he had demanded <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 18.</note>, rendred himself at the Diet of <hi>Soleurre,</hi> where he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cantons all to unite themselves to labour for the restitution of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to the <hi>Grisons</hi> their Allies, and promised them all sort of assistance to effectuate that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. He added, That if they judged it would not be restored so soon as his most Christian Majesty desired, it was their Prudence to provide for its Preservation; and that he offer'd, in the King's Name, to conform himself to what they should judge to the purpose, and to maintain it, either with such Expences as were necessary, or such a Party as they should think fit. The same Day the Cantons having framed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of their Diet, they declared, That it was just that the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Chiavenne</hi> and <hi>Bormio,</hi> should be restored to the <hi>Grisons</hi> their ancient Possessors, on which they join'd in Opinion with the Sentiments of the King of <hi>France,</hi> represented to them by his Ambassadour. The Nuncio <hi>Scappi</hi> opposed this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:187699:102"/> Resolution as much as he could; but as it was clearly known, that he only sought for the Pope's or the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> advantage, and not that of the <hi>Swisse</hi> Allies, it was easie for the Mareschal to refute what he said. The <hi>Swissers,</hi> although but little exercised in political Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, found very well that the latter had reason, and gave him <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 17.</note>, at the determination of their Diet, a Writing, which imported, That the Cantons had formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and could now find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to the purpose, than to persist in the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Valteline, Chiavenne,</hi> and <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi> ought to be restored to the Three Leagues of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> conformable to that Treaty, without changing any thing, and with the Conditions therein contain'd, to re-establish the exercise of both Religions. As for other things, which the Mareschal had proposed, the Deputies answer'd, That they would report them to their Superiours. Thus the Mareschal having successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquitted himself of his Commission, returned to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the beginning of the Year, the Pope declared the Cardinal <hi>Francis Barberin</hi> Legate into <hi>Spain,</hi> altho' there was no appearance that he would have any better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> than he had with the <hi>French.</hi> The Cardinal receiv'd the Cross the 27th. of <hi>January,</hi> in a Consistory expresly for that end. A little while after, there was a Promotion made of Twelve Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, amongst whom were <hi>Marquemont</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and <hi>Spada</hi> Nuncio in <hi>France,</hi> of whom I have often spoken. To give the greater Authority to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the Pope dispatched order to several Persons to levy Troops, to the end, as was said, to send them into the Forts of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which should be restored to him. These Troops soon after advanced towards the Frontiers of the Ecclesiastical State, to traverse the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanese,</hi> and enter into the Forts which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> yet held; and after they had taken them into their hands, to demand those which the <hi>French</hi> had taken: That if the <hi>French</hi> refused to surrender the Forts which they had, these Troops, as the Pope said, were to endeavour to recover them; not to break with <hi>France,</hi> but only to aid those of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to shake off the <hi>Grisons</hi> Yoak:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:187699:102"/> As the King's Ministers had said the Year before, That he had not a design to attack the Pope's Troops, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aid the <hi>Grisons.</hi> After they had retaken these Forts, the Pope pretended he would keep them in Deposit, in which time they might agree between themselves. Others believed, that the Pope having promised the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to regain the Forts, he would only appear willing to keep his Word, without going further; and the Pontiff himself declared this afterwards to the Count <hi>de Bethunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were presently surprized in <hi>France</hi> at this Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Pope; and when they had understood from the Nuncio's mouth, that the Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> was gone for <hi>Spain,</hi> they fear'd there was some secret Treaty between the Pope and that Crown. But the Nuncio having declared, not only that the Pope would do nothing but for the Publick Good, but also that he should not be angry if the Two Crowns could agree between themselves, without his intermedling; it was believed necessary to conclude with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for <hi>du Fargis</hi> had begun to treat secretly with the Count <hi>d'Olivarez.</hi> To oblige the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to render themselves to Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so advantageous to <hi>France,</hi> they had then made the Peace with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> but with design to re-attack <hi>Rochelle,</hi> as soon as the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>In the interim, to prevent their surprize, they sent Forces and Money to the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres,</hi> with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to make new Levies among the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Swissers,</hi> and to stand upon his guard. The Pope's Troops, composed of Six thousand Foot, and Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horse, advanced but slowly, because the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were to furnish them with Victuals and Ammunition, did not perform with necessary diligence. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, the Pope received the news that the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Crowns was concluded, by the Count <hi>d'Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>du Fargis,</hi> which rid him of a great trouble, and caused him to demonstrate a great deal of Joy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambassador at <hi>Madrid,</hi> after he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to discover the Disposition of the Count <hi>d'Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez,</hi> without attending new Orders, sign'd a Treaty
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:187699:103"/> on the 16th. of <hi>January</hi> before he communicated it to the Court, and after sent it to <hi>France.</hi> They had writ to him some Weeks before, to treat with much precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not at all to engage himself rashly: But he was advanced already so far in the Negotiation when he receiv'd those Orders, that he conceiv'd he could not go back. Otherwise having many times observ'd, that the two principal Articles which <hi>France</hi> endeavour'd to gain, were to preserve the Soveraignty of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> desist from the Passage of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline,</hi> he seem'd to have answer'd his Instructions, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining these two things.</p>
               <p>But they were strangely surpriz'd in <hi>France,</hi> or at least feign'd so to be, when they saw a Treaty so important, as that was, sign'd, said they, without Order, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their previous sight. The first thing they spoke of was, to repeal the Duke of <hi>Fargis,</hi> and to declare the Treaty void. They remain'd some days in this Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the Ministers highly blam'd so precipitate a Management. But they said afterwards, That they fear'd, that if they wholly disapprov'd of this Treaty, it would rather be attributed to the Levity of the Court, than to the Incapacity of <hi>du Fargis,</hi> because this was not the first time that they had retracted what the Ministers had done. Furthermore, they perceiv'd by the Discourse of the Marquis <hi>de Mirabel,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> regarded not this Treaty, as, so well concluded, that nothing might be changed; which made the King resolve to send a Courier to <hi>du Fargis,</hi> to reproach his Rashness, and to let him know that he ought to repair his Fault, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Treaty which he had made in such haste. They sent him at the same time the manner after which they extended the Articles, should be changed, and order to put a great value on this Variation, as being a most sensible Mark of the Christian King's Inclination to Peace. They added, that if the Count-Duke would subscribe the Articles, as they had corrected them, he should sign them also; and that at the same time he should give notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the foreign Ministers who were at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> by telling them, That without Commission, and on his proper hazarded, he had signed a Treaty which he thought advantageous, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> therein
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:187699:103"/> renounced their Claim to the passage of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and restor'd the Soveraignty of that Country to the <hi>Grisons:</hi> That if the Duke refused to make any change in the Treaty, he should take leave immediately, and come to give an account of his Conduct: But if the <hi>Spanish</hi> Minister would change any thing, he should send those Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Court, without showing them to those of the foreign Princes.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>du Fargis</hi> having received these Orders, took Horse to repair to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was then gone to the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and which he found at <hi>Barcelona.</hi> He spoke so strenuously to the King and the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they comported with suffering what was altered in the Treaty; but he would not accept of all those which they proposed, they should agree to more than by precedent the Treaty. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, <hi>du Fargis</hi> believing he had repair'd his Fault, omitted not to sign it, because the Count would not give him time to write into <hi>France.</hi> This being done, he gave notice to the Ministers, who were with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Train: <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. p. 112.</note> But he agreed with the Count <hi>de Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez,</hi> that the Treaty should be dated <hi>March</hi> 16. 1626. as made at <hi>Monzon,</hi> though it was done at <hi>Barcelona;</hi> because they were unwilling that the Legate, who was before come to that City, should concern himself in it, because of the Delays that would have caused; which occasion'd their telling him, as hath been said, that the Treaty was concluded before his arrival.</p>
               <p>The principal Articles of this Treaty were reduced to these:</p>
               <p n="1">I. <q>That the Affairs of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and of the <hi>Valteline</hi> should be remitted into the same Estate in which they were, in 1617. By which means, the Soveraignty as conserved to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and the absolute dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Passage to <hi>France,</hi> in whose power it then was.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <q>That there should for ever, in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> no other but the Catholick Religion be exercised in the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <q>That the Inbabitants of this Country might chuse their Governours and their Magistrates all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, either <hi>Grisons,</hi> or of the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:187699:104"/> IV. <q>That this Election should be confirm'd by the <hi>Grisons,</hi> without power to reject it.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. <q>That all the Forts of the <hi>Valteline</hi> should be put into the hands of the Pope, to be immediately ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</q>
               </p>

               <p>The Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> communicated the Substance of this Treaty, before it had been corrected, to the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who was come to Court to make Complaints against the Constable and his Son-in-Law; and as that Prince saw that there was no particular care taken of the Interests of his House, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly enraged at this Treaty; and the Ministers of <hi>France,</hi> as to comfort him, exceedingly complain'd of <hi>du Fargis;</hi> but they added, That the King, that he might not pass for a Prince of little Credit, had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ratifie what he had signed, because it would never be believ'd to have been done without order. <hi>Contarini,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassadour, complain'd no less of this Treaty, in which he pretended the Republick ought to have had a part; and he was the more angry, because being <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The Treaty of <hi>Monzon</hi> being corrected, as I have said, and ratified by the King, after the Courier which carried the ratification into <hi>Spain</hi> was return'd, it was communicated to the Ambassadors of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Savoy;</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> was already departed, ill satisfied with the Court, where he had not been receiv'd with the former Honours, though they gave him no Reason for it. When <hi>Charles Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> was advertis'd by his Ambassador of what had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he spoke of the Ministers in most opprobrious Terms, and particularly design'd the Cardinal, whom
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:187699:104"/> he treated as if guilty of a most prodigious Treachery. The Ambassador <hi>Contarini</hi> would also withdraw, and spoke extreamly ill of all the Ministers, but especially of that same Cardinal, whom he call'd Dissembler and Cheat. In effect, it was visible they were all chous'd by him, by his denying that the King treated with <hi>Spain,</hi> and with feeding them with hopes for the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, whilst at the same time the Treaty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding. It was believ'd, that though the Court grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Du Fargis,</hi> he had done nothing without the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Participation, without which he never durst have signed two Treaties without order. It is a Fault too gross, and where all that Minister can hold most dear is too visibly concern'd, to fall into once, far from being guilty of committing the same fault twice one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal at this time <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.

But his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement during the two Years of his Ministry which were elaps'd, and the designs which he had propos'd demonstrated the contrary. He gave, besides, many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons, which could perswade no body, as when he assur'd Cardinal <hi>Spada,</hi> that he desir'd to make a Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and stay there three Months, at a time when his presence was most necessary at Court, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himself against those who envied him for the great Authority he had acquir'd.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:187699:105"/> the Enterprizes of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> aad the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was the chief of it. As he was no ways in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to resist him with the Forces of the Confederates and his own, he endeavour'd to induce <hi>France</hi> to break with <hi>Spain,</hi> to hinder it from assisting the Emperour. The Cardinal gave him some hopes as to divers other Princes, that the Crowns would suddenly fall to an open War; and the Affairs of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and the <hi>Valteline</hi> seem'd to be Preludes. The Interest of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> which the King said publickly he would maintain as his own, seem'd incompatible with the Pretensions of <hi>Spain,</hi> which there was no appearance they would recede from.</p>
               <p>But the King, after he had spoke so highly of the care he would take of his Allies, almost wholly desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, since he permitted the <hi>Grisons</hi> to be stripp'd of their Civil Government, as well as the liberty of the exercise of their Religion in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> without any appearances of right to give away that which belong'd not to him, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had no more any reason to require it. But the Interest of the <hi>Grisons</hi> was that which was least thought of, though the thing most talked of; and by misfortune they were too weak to resent it, and the <hi>Swissers</hi> too good people to take their part with that heat which the Case requir'd. The Cardinal even thought not of the King's Honour, on which he had in appearance so strongly insisted, but only as it promoted his particular Interests. It was this was the cause of the conclusion of the Treaty of <hi>Monzon,</hi> it not being advantageous to the Cardinal, that the State, in the beginning of his favour, should be embarass'd in a Foreign War, whilst they labour'd at home to take from him that Supream Authority, which he began to usurp over the other Ministers.</p>
               <p>It was hereupon said, That the Mareschal <hi>de Roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laure</hi> being dead, the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who was after call'd the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had demanded the Battoon for the Colonel <hi>D'Ornano,</hi> his Governour, but could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. A little after, an Army was prepar'd to go against <hi>Rochelle.</hi> Monsieur desir'd the command of it; but as it was known that he was push'd on by the Colonel, who would command it in his Name, the King let him know, that his Request should be granted if he would dismiss
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:187699:105"/>
                  <hi>D'Ornano.</hi> This unexpected Answer extraordinarily fretted him; and he chose rather to forego what he had desir'd, than to deprive himself of a Man in whom he had plac'd his greatest confidence. Nevertheless he press'd the King so hard to grant him the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schals Staff, that it was deliberated in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, whether it was better to gratifie Monsieur, or rid themselves of the Colonel, by making him away. In fine, the King concluded rather to give his Brother the pleasure to see his Governour a Mareschal, than cause him to be kill'd.</p>

So that after he had endeavour'd to gain <hi>Ornano,</hi> were it for his personal Qualities, or because he was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the only Brother of the King, whose Health was little firm, and had no Children; when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd he could not compass his end, he begun to look upon the Mareschal as a Man whom he ought to distrust. There needed no more to work his destruction; and the Cardinal took measures to render him culpable. In this Affair he made use of good Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Instrument in his most important and secret Designs. The Capuchin feign'd to have a most particular Esteem and Friendship for the Mareschal, and made him know as his Friend, That it was time that he should think of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Matters, so as Monsieur might be admitted into the Council, to acquire some knowledge of the Affairs of State. He said moreover, that That Prince need not fear a Refusal, not only in regard to his Birth, but also to his Merit. Nothing could be said which more agreeably flatter'd the Ambition of the Mareschal, who look'd upon the advancement of his Master as his own. We easily believe what we fansy, and find a thousand Reasons to support it. The Mareschal judged in effect, that the Weal-publick requir'd that the Duke of <hi>Anj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u</hi> should learn the Art of reigning, since the King being Childless, the Crown would one day fall on his Head. And it is certain, that if Monsieur were one of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:187699:106"/> Council, he would be sure to get the Mareschal admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This last, swell'd with these Thoughts, open'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thereupon to the King, and told him, It would do well if his Brother got some Cognizance of the Affairs of a Crown, for whose Preservation he was so deeply concern'd; but if he were not admitted into the Council, the Command of the Armies was at least to be granted to him.</p>
               <p>The King told the Proposition to the Cardinal, which the Mareschal <hi>d'Ornano</hi> had made. It was no hard thing to the Cardinal to term this Request after a most odious manner, and to perswade the King to deny him all. The King, fearful and jealous, easily believ'd as the Cardinal said, That the Mareschal inspir'd too ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thoughts into a Prince who was immediately to succeed his Majesty in case he had no Children; and that he demanded the Command of an Army, only to make use of it against him that gave it; or at least to share the Crown with him. The Cardinal easily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw, that Monsieur's being refus'd what he sought for, would cause him to withdraw from Court; or if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd there, he would not fail to shew his disgust in such Words as would easily augment the King's Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie. In the Interim, this Prelate always entertain'd the Mareschal with an outward Friendship, which he had shewn towards him for a long time, and in publick prais'd him, whilst in private he ruin'd him in the King's Thoughts, by making him sensible, that he might one day draw Monsieur into some design distructive to the State. He had wonderful success in these sorts of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, because he seem'd to have no other concern but the King's Interest, upon which all his Fortune and Authority depended; whilst his Enviers seem'd to have other Masters on whom their Preferment more relied than on the King.</p>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:187699:106"/> told Monsieur, That if he espous'd one of the King's Subjects, he would himself become more a Subject than before, and their Fortune would be absolutely in the Hands of the King and the Minister; That if at that time he could make a Foreign Alliance, he might one day have need of it, if the King gave himself over to the haughty and violent Spirit of the Cardinal; That in such a Conjuncture he would not find any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour either within the Kingdom or without, unless he were strictly allied to some Sovereign House capable to assist him.</p>

But the more urgent he was, the farther he found the King from granting his Desires; which made him shew his discontent in Terms very displeasing to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. Two Days after, the King being at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> caus'd him to be arrested▪ with <hi>Masargues,</hi> his Brother, <hi>Chaudebon</hi> Groom of the Chambers, and many others suspected by the Minister, who were sent to the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Monsieur receiving this News, run to complain to the King; and as he entred his Apartment he was surpriz'd that admission was refus'd to his Train, which more augmented his Sorrow. The first of the Council which he met with was the Chancellor <hi>d' Aligre,</hi> whom he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:187699:107"/> If it was by his Advice that they had put the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>d'Ornano</hi> into Prison? <hi>D' Aligre</hi> fearing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Duke, replied, That he was surpriz'd at it himself, and knew not the Reason, not having been at the Council when that Resolution was taken; which was false. This weak Answer for a Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> who ought, as Head of the Council, to have answer'd, That the King without doubt had very good Reasons, offended the King, or rather the Cardinal, who would not allow that people should faintly manage his Designs: And but a little after <note n="*" place="margin">About the end of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </note> the Seals were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from <hi>d' Aligre</hi> to be given to <hi>Marillac,</hi> Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Finances, and entirely depending on the Cardinal. Monsieur afterwards ask'd the Cardinal the same Question, who answer'd him fiercely, That for him he would not speak to him as the Chancellor had done; and that both of them had counselled the King to put the Mareschal in Prison, for what the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had related to them. He should have said upon the Advice he himself had given the King, who now saw nothing but by his Eyes. This occasion'd a Libel at that time to be publish'd against him, intituled, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery</hi>'s Life of the Card. lib. 2. c. 8.</note>
                  <hi>The King of the King;</hi> in which they shew'd, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal took as much Authority over the Will of the King, as the King did upon that of his other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>But to return to Monsieur; he complain'd highly to the King of the Imprisonment of the Mareschal; he told him, That they ought also to put him and <hi>Gaston</hi> in Prison, because he was as guilty as <hi>Ornano;</hi> that they might lawfully accuse both the one and the other of having too much Affection for his Majesty, and the good of the State; That as for him, if they put the Mareschal to death, notwithstanding his Innocency, he would die with him; That he saw he was fallen into the Snare which his Enemies had laid long since; but he hop'd that the Justice of his Majesty would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his Brother and an Officer of the Crown, to the Fury of their Enemies; That if he ever discover'd the Author of the Mareschals Imprisonment, there was nothing but the Arms of the King should save him from lawful Revenge.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:187699:107"/>
               <p> The more <hi>Gaston</hi> was transported in favour of the Mareschal, the more it perswaded the King, that <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> was absolutely Master of his Brother's Spirit, and that he abus'd his Power over him. These very Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports produc'd yet two effects which the Cardinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd, which was, that they augmented the distrust which the Cardinal endeavour'd to raise in the King's Mind against Monsieur; and that the ill Humour which the King shew'd to his Brother, kept that Prince in fear, and hindred him from undertaking any thing.</p>
               <p>The King answer'd him, That if the Mareschal should be found culpable, he believ'd Monsieur too good a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enter into the design of making disturbances; That they made use of his Name, but he would always distinguish the Interests of his Brother from those of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano. Gaston</hi> replied, That he would die sooner than desert a Man no way guilty, but for being his Servant; but yet he could not hinder his being carried to the <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> as I have already said. In the mean time that Prince sent <hi>Capestan,</hi> Lieutenant of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Corsi,</hi> to carry a Letter to the Mareschal <hi>d'Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano</hi>'s Lady; by which he declar'd to her the good Offices which he endeavour'd to render to her Spouse, and the part he took in her Grief. The Cardinal, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd by his Spies, that Monsieur wrote to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal's Lady, caus'd Guards to be presently set to all the Avenues of the Forest of <hi>Fontain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Capestan,</hi> who had been Page to the Mareschal <hi>d'Ornano,</hi> made his Passage through the Guards; of which he wounded some. The Mareschal's Lady instantly return'd Answer, to thank the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and gave the Letter to one of her People, disguis'd as a Lacquey, to give it to <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> or to <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This last receiv'd it, and as he was the Cardinal's Pensioner, he deliver'd it to him: After which, he told Monsieur, seeming to be in a Passion, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Letter from the Mareschals Lady, but that he had lost it. This poor Prince saw suddenly afterwards who had found it, when the Cardinal caus▪d it to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:187699:108"/> how to secure himself against the Infidelity of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks, nor to punish those who had betray'd him; and it was said of the Abbot <hi>de la Riviere, That he might very well know what his Master weighed, since he had sold him several times.</hi> Thus then, when that Prince went to speak to the King in behalf of the Mareschal, he found the King ready to answer him, knowing what he was about to say; because <hi>Gaston</hi> put confidence in his people, who told all to the Cardinal.

But the Opinion which he had, that the King desir'd not he should end his Life by a Death so little Honourable, to which he could not be expos'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wounding of the Royal Authority, gave him the boldness to supplicate his Majesty to think sit that he might withdraw himself from Court; and that by his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:187699:108"/> Retreat he should ruin the Designs of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, by taking from them the pretext they had made use of for the abating his too great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal wrote the same thing to the Queen-Mother, and entreated her to obtain for him this Favour of the King; which, as he said, ought to be the less denied him, because he fear'd, that managing his Health no better than he had hitherto done, he should not be long able to administer Affairs. But this demand which he made, after it had given the King an Alarm, and made him believe that the Cardinal was the Man of the Kingdom the most exempt from Ambition, though his Enemies accus'd him of the contrary: The King, who dreaded to fall into the Hands of his Brother, whom he had often us'd but ill, had no mind to forego the Cardinal in this Conjuncture: He therefore wrote him a Letter with his own Hand <note n="*" place="margin">Dated at <hi>Blois, June</hi> 9.</note>, consorted with the Queen-Mother's who wanted the Cardinal more than the King; by which his Majesty entreated this Prelate not to think of a Retreat. The King said to him, That his Service had been always infinitely advantageous to him, but it was at present necessary to the State, and that without the support of his Ministry, all the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of the Crown would run to final destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That he promis'd him his protection against the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and against all the Princes and all the Lords; That as he had discover'd to him by what had pass'd, the Evil which was spoken of him, thenceforward he would tell him all the Calumnies which he should hear spoken, and the Names of the Calumniators, without requiring any justification from him, being too much convinc'd of his Fidelity by his Services.</p>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:187699:109"/> the nine, discover'd this Design to the Commander of <hi>Valençay,</hi> but could not gain him. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Commander censur'd him openly, that he being a Domestick of the King's, durst engage in such an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize against the first Minister. He added, That he ought to give him notice of it; and if he did not, he would himself go and discover. He, frightned by the Threats of <hi>Valençay,</hi> consented to it, they both parted to go to <hi>Fleury;</hi> and <hi>Chalais</hi> declar'd to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal one part of what he knew; That Monsieur was to feign that he would come and dine at <hi>Fleury,</hi> and that he should in the Morning send his Officers, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, to prepare his Dinner, but in the bottom to encrease his Force. The Cardinal thanked the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis and the Commander, and prayed them to go and tell the King the same at <hi>Fontainbleau:</hi> They were there in an instant; and at eleven a Clock at Night, the King order'd thirty of his <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> and as many Light Horse, to march instantly to <hi>Fleury,</hi> and to do what the Cardinal should appoint them. The Queen-Mother also sent all her Officers to assist on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p>It fell out just as <hi>Chalais</hi> had said, about three of the Clock in the Morning, Monsieur's Officers came to <hi>Fleury,</hi> as if they were to make a Dinner ready for him. Then the Cardinal left them his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and went, well accompanied, to <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and directly to Monsieur's Chamber, who was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and was extreamly surprized to see him. He expostulated with the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> That he had not done him the Honour to command him to get a Dinner for him, and said, he would not have got the worst; but he had left his House to his People as soon as they appeared. The Cardinal's Enemies could not apprehend how he had discover'd this Design against him, because they believ'd that they had trusted it with persons only of whom they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd. The Cardinal said he had the first Intelligence from Foreign Countries, but apparently to hide him who had discover'd the others. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Mem. de Bassomp.</hi> T. 2. p. 364.</note> But <hi>Chalais</hi> chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them a second time; he confess'd to those who had formed the Design against the Cardinal, that it was he who had discover'd it, for fear that <hi>Valençay</hi> should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him, and promised them to be more faithful for the future, giving them this notice of his Fault for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his Sincerity.</p>
               <p>Thus the Party broke not off for this; and there were accused besides the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> divers Persons of the First Rank, as the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Vendôme,</hi> the Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Chevreuse,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and many Persons of lesser Quality.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Court being gone to <hi>Blois, Chalais,</hi> whose Chamber was contiguous to <hi>Gaston</hi>'s Apartment, had divers Conferences with him in that Prince's Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in the night, of which the Cardinal wanted not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement. The Grand Prior, who was of the Party, seeing by that first Imprudence of <hi>Chalais</hi> the Affair was discover'd, affected to make great Complements to the Cardinal, incomparably more fine than his. That Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late receiving him always perfectly well, and feigning to be entirely for his Interests, the Grand Prior believ'd him so much his Friend, that he pray'd him one day to obtain for him the Charge of Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> which was then the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s. The Cardinal feign'd, that he had thoughts of it himself; and said, that he would cause the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> to be spoke to about it, or so order things that the King should suppress it, and give the exercise of it by Commission to the Grand Prior. He added, that it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Duke his Brother, who was in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Britaigne,</hi> to come to the Court with him, to give the King Thanks. The Duke of <hi>Vendôme,</hi> who loved not the Cardinal, and who knew his revengeful Spirit, would not have come to Court, for fear of being play'd some trick; and the Cardinal, resolved to take his Government from him, sought all ways to get him out by force or by cunning, as opportunity should present. The Grand Prior nevertheless, fearful of his Brother's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not able to make him resolve to come to Court
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:187699:110"/> without some assurance, demanded of the King, if he might come thither without danger, because of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which run, that there was a Conspiracy of <hi>d'Ornano;</hi> and the King answer'd him in an equivocal manner, That no more harm should be done to his Brother than to him. This Prince, who suffer'd himself to be cheated by his Ministers, was nevertheless a sufficient Dissembler, when those who possess'd his Spirit told him he was to be so.</p>
               <p>The Grand Prior, deceiv'd by this equivocal Answer, dictated perhaps by the Cardinal, who was a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of such things, went to the Duke his Brother into <hi>Bretaigne;</hi> and they came Post to the Court, which was then at <hi>Blois</hi> *, in the beginning of <hi>June.</hi> The Duke <note place="margin">† <hi>June</hi> 2. <hi>Bassom. Mem.</hi> T. 2. p. 365. <hi>&amp; Siri, Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. p. 139.</note> found the King, who was walking in the Garden, and said, coming up towards him, That at the first signal of his Majesty, he was come to cast himself at his feet, to assure him of his Obedience, and to tell him, that he would never have other Designs, nor other Inclinations, but what should be to render him most humble Services. The King laying his hand on his Shoulder, told him, that he had impatiently long'd to see him, and invited him to hunt on the morrow. But the Duke excused himself, being wearied with coming Post from <hi>Bretaigne.</hi> The two Brothers were lodg'd in two Chambers of the Castle, and in the morning they receiv'd and paid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits, without dreaming of the turn which was to be play'd them. They were both arrested the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; at two hours after midnight they were awaken'd, to be carried to the Castle of <hi>Amboise,</hi> under a sure Guard. But when the Court return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> they were brought from thence to the <hi>Bois de Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst they were ordering this Affair, the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> did all he could to obtain the liberty of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>d'Ornano</hi> from the Cardinal; and seeing all his Instances were in vain with this implacable Minister, he consulted about withdrawing from Court. But those in whom he confided having diverted him from it, he sent the President <hi>le Coigneux,</hi> who had succeeded the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal in Monsieur's Government, but who then depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much more on the Cardinal than on him, to that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:187699:110"/> Prelate, to demand four things on his behalf: The first was, That the Proceedings against the Mareschal <hi>d'Ornano</hi> might be stopp'd. The second, That the King would encrease, by an hundred thousand Franks, the Expences of Monsieur's House. The third, That this Prince might marry to whom and when he pleas'd. The fourth, That they would give him security in a Month's time to settle his Portion. The Cardinal, after he had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them to press hard upon him, agreed to these four Demands, although he said they were exorbitant; but with a design to keep none but what he found to his purpose. He added, That he would serve Monsieur al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as much as possible he could; and would make him clearly to see, that he had done nothing but what was for his Service. The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> caused Thanks to be return'd to the Cardinal, and seem'd to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted for all the Mischiefs they had done him, until the King sent him word of the Imprisonment of the Brothers of <hi>Vendôme,</hi> and to tell him, that things had not been brought to that extremity, but for very forcible Reasons. Monsieur, as well as the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> liv'd with themselves in a very great Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and deliberated a second time to withdraw from Court; but having no sure Refuge, it was necessary they should expect, whether the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi> would receive them into <hi>Metz;</hi> and the Marquis having refus'd it, because the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> his Father did not think it fit, Monsieur remain'd at Court.</p>
               <p>The Court being come to <hi>Nants,</hi> the King establish'd a Chamber of Justice, which made out <hi>Chalais</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and <note n="*" place="margin">

There was great murmuring in <hi>France,</hi> at the erecting of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Tribunal, to judge one Man, who being Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, might have been condemn'd in any Parliament the King should have named, and ought not to have been Tried by Judges who were the Cardinal's Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, who was secretly his Prosecutor. But the Prelate by establishing a new Method of Justice, would strike an Awe into them who durst attack his Favour, that all might imagine there was no way to avoid his Revenge, by the way of Formalities, establish'd by the Laws in favour of Innocents. After this time, the Ministers have
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:187699:111"/> many times made use of this way, to destroy those they did not love; and the Kings, under pretext of inhancing their Authority, have sacrificed the Laws of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to the Passions of their Favourites.</p>
               <p>One of the Friends of <hi>Chalais</hi> putting confidence in the Count <hi>de Lovigny,</hi> had told him Monsieur's Design to leave the Court, and to diminish the too great Authority of the First Minister. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Lovigny,</hi> enraged against <hi>Chalais,</hi> who had forsaken him in a Quarrel which he had, went to discover all to the King, and perhaps told him more than was truth. It was said, that he affirmed, That <hi>Chalais,</hi> who was Master of the King's Wardrobe, was, by Monsieur's order, to poison one of his Majesty's Shirts. There was no appearance of the truth of this, the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> being naturally of a sweet and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Temper; but they were willing to afright the King, to exasperate him the more easily against all those who were not enclin'd to crouch to the Authority of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. It is true, that the Duke, fearful and mutable, made a Declaration at <hi>Nants,</hi> of the 11th of <hi>August,</hi> wherein he accused <hi>Chalais</hi> to have counselled him to withdraw from the Court, and to have given him ways how to do it; a Baseness which he was more than once in his life guilty of, as you will see in the sequel of this History. He may justly be accused for want of Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of deserting those who had served him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate himself; but for such heinous Crimes, there was but small appearance he could be guilty. Let it be as it will, <hi>Chalais</hi> (being taken with divers Papers, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Witnesses who deposed against him) maintain'd, that he had never re-entred into the Faction which was framed against the Cardinal, but to serve that Prelate, who had order'd him to do it. But as he faithfully serv'd Monsieur's Party, he endeavour'd to cheat the Minister, to draw some Reward from him, whilst he was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to give. <hi>Chalais</hi> would say nothing to the Keeper of the Seals, Head of the Chamber of Justice; but the Cardinal speaking to him, the declar'd all that he knew of the Malecontents. <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Siri,</hi> T. 6. p. 150, 159. <hi>Mem. d' Aubery,</hi> T. 1. p 287.</note> It was reported, that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late promised him his Favour and Rewards, if he would discover not only what came to his Knowledge, but if he would also depose some things, which he told him;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:187699:111"/> and that he was worse than his Word, after he had drawn out of him what he pleased.</p>
               <p>Monsieur being reconciled to the Court, his Marriage with Madamoiselle <hi>de Montpensier</hi> was talk'd of. He had made many Intrigues to put it off, and to induce the King and Queen to hinder this Marriage; but the Queen-Mother and the Cardinal desiring it, it was at last brought to a conclusion. The Queen <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri,</hi> ibid. p. 155.</note> fear'd, that Monsieur coming to have Children, she should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised; and it is said, that the Mareschal <hi>d'Ornano</hi> had told her, that if the King died, the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> might very well marry her. They had also talked of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the King impotent, and putting him into a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and giving <hi>Gaston</hi> to the Queen, without staying for his death. They had <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri,</hi> ibid. p. 157.</note> also made the King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, by means of <hi>Tronson</hi> and <hi>Marillac,</hi> and of <hi>Souve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre,</hi> and even of <hi>Baradas</hi> the King's Favourite, but who medled not with any Affairs of State; that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur being married to a rich Heiress, allied to the House of <hi>Guise</hi> (for her Mother <hi>Catharine Henriette de Joyeuse,</hi> had espoused the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> in her second Marriage) and having a considerable Portion, his Authority would become so great at the Court, especially if he had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that his Favour would be fought for more than his Majesty's, who had no Children, and whose Health was so weak; whereas his Brother was of an excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. These Discourses had made such an impression in the King, that Father <hi>Suffren,</hi> Confessor to the Queen-Mother, going one day to see him in his Cabinet, this Prince, over-whelm'd with Sorrow, cast his Arms about his Neck, and began to tell him, That he saw very well that his Mother could not forget what had pass'd on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Mareschal <hi>d' Ancre;</hi> and that she had more Kindness for Monsieur than for him, because she procur'd more considerable Advantages for him. Father <hi>Suffren</hi> endeavour'd to disabuse the King, and to make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that that Marriage was for the good of the State, and for the service of his Majesty. But it was impossible presently to take away all his Suspicions. In this Conjuncture, the Queen-Mother fear'd to be once more remov'd from Affairs, and the Cardinal to be sent to <hi>Rome;</hi> so that they did all they could to know who
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:187699:112"/> had cast these Mists over the King's Mind; for the good Prince was almost incapable to find any Thought to fix on. In fine, the Queen-Mother by force of Tears pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with the King to tell those who had thus distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his Spirit: He nam'd them all except <hi>Baradas,</hi> and they were instantly dismiss'd the Court.</p>
               <p>The King being appeas'd, Monsieur's Marriage with Madamoiselle <hi>de Montpensier</hi> was concluded the 5th. of <hi>August,</hi> and was soon after consummated.

Monsieur had moreover a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Five hundred and sixty thousand Livres an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Pension; so that he had more than a Million of Livres Revenue.

With such considerable Revenues, Monsieur thought of nothing but plunging himself into Pleasures, and seem'd to have forgot all things past.</p>
               <p>Thus there was none but he, amongst the Cardinal's Enemies, who got out of the Conspiracy without disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Dutchess of <hi>Chevreuse,</hi> of whom the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Chalais</hi> was amorous, and by whom he was also favour'd, being accused to have persuaded Monsieur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Marriage, and to have advised him to leave the Court, was banish'd into <hi>Lorrain.</hi>

               <p>Before the Court departed from <hi>Nants,</hi> the King caused the Queen to appear in Council; and having reproached her that she thought of a second Husband, made her read the Deposition of <hi>Chalais;</hi> where it was said, that it had been talk'd of putting the King into a Monastery, and declaring him impotent, and marrying the Duke of

                  <hi>Orleans</hi> with the Queen. Were it that the Friends of <hi>Gaston</hi> had in effect made such Discourses, or that it was a Fiction, it seem'd decent they should have spared that Princess from this Shame, and hinder'd it from coming to the ears of the King. But that was not the Cardinal's Interest, to whose advantage it was that the King should distrust all his nearest Relations, and evil intreat them; because after that, there remain'd none whom he could confide in but this Prelate.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> who, amongst other things, was accused to have counselled Monsieur to retire to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and to put himself in the head of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party, durst stay no longer at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he then was. He went for <hi>Italy,</hi> and at the same time demanded the King's Licence, who had rather have him at a distance from Court than near the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> It was easie under this Pretext, to keep as far off as he pleased, as had been done a little before by the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who was not yet return'd to the Court, though he had seen the Cardinal at his House of <hi>Limours.</hi>

He made a Discourse upon the cause of his Imprisonment; and swore upon the Salvation of his Soul, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had never any Thought against the Person of the King, and that any of his Confidents had ever given him such Counsels: That the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> seeing himself entirely excluded the Government, which was pass'd into the hands of the Cardinal, had only sought means to lessen the excessive Authority of this Minister, and to obtain some for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: That whatever more was said, was false, or else never came to his knowledge. In the sequel, he receiv▪d the Sacrament, and died soon after.</p>

               <p> In the mean time, the Depositions of <hi>Chalais</hi> said a great deal more; and the Cardinal publish'd, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 148.</note> That if the Conspirators had had some Months more, they would have been strong enough to have depriv'd the King of the Crown, as by their Design they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd. He complaining one day to Cardinal <hi>Spada,</hi> of the trouble which the Ministry gave him, told him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things, That the Queen-Mother and he ceased not to recommend to the King, with all possible care, to do the Duty of a good Husband, if he would put the Kingdom in repose: That the King did in effect what was possible for him, considering the natural aversion which he had for it, and the disgust given him by the vanity of the Queen, augmented by Persons who were near her: That the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who was so troublesome to the King, might very well be arrested, and put in Prison; but besides that the Queen-Mother had too much repugnance for that, it was dangerous in such a Kingdom as <hi>France,</hi> and in a time when the King was young and destitute of Children. He also complain'd of the little Generosity of the King, who had scarcely given him any thing, altho' he knew that the Carninal had not above 50000 Crowns Rent, and yet his Expences were double the summ: But he praised the Munificence of the Queen-Mother, who knowing he was in debts, had paid part of them, without acquainting him with it.</p>
               <p>Before the King left <hi>Bretaigne</hi> to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> he held an Assembly of the States of that Province, the Government whereof he took from the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dôme,</hi> and gave it to the Mareschal <hi>de Themines:</hi>

But I will make no demurr on that, but continue to relate what more particularly concerns the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu;</hi> nevertheless, I will first tell you, that the Constable of <hi>Lesdeguieres</hi> died about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> at the Age of fourscore years, and left great Riches to the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> his Son-in-Law; and that about the same time, <hi>Baradas</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced; and that <hi>S. Simon,</hi> who also was a Page to his Majesty, succeed him in Favour, but without any more concern in the Government than his Predecessor.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal having offended all the Princes of the Blood, and attracted the Hatred of all the best Qualified Lords of the Kingdom, by his haughty and proud way of governing all, under the Name of the King, to whom it was already in vain to address for any thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without the Consent of the Minister, he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear not only his Authority envied by the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, but also his Life. As he respected nothing, when he was minded to hurt, assured of having the King's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in all things, it might easily happen that his Enemies might take such ways to destroy him, as were not conformable to the Formalities of Justice: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took course, that the Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> should speak to the King of the danger his prime Minister was in, if his Majesty did not provide for his Security. The King, who knew that <hi>Spada</hi> was no Friend to Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> was surprized at this good Office, and admired the Vertue of that Prelate, who knew how to change the Hatred which was born him, into Friendship. A few days after, he gave him Fifty Arquebusiers on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, to prevent Attempts on his Person. At another time he said in the presence of the Queen-Mother and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> That knowing <note n="*" place="margin">

The Cardinal, who was ravish'd at this, sell to thank the King and to intreat him not to do it, but in a Tone which shew'd he was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:187699:114"/> willing to be refused. He added, the more to engage the King not to receive his Excuses, That if he should lose his Life for his Majesty's Service, his Death would be glorious, and he should live in the Memory of the King, which was a Comfort beyond all which could happen to him. But the King again saying he would have it so, the Cardinal humbly disposed himself to have Guards as well as his Majesty.</p>
               <p>The King ordain'd him farther, for his greater secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that no person should importune the Cardinal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout particular Affairs; and that for the Publick, they should speak first to some other Minister, to the end that if it were necessary the Cardinal should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, he should give an Order in Writing, to be shewn to the Captain of the Prelate's Guards, who should suffer none to enter but those who brought it. These Precautions were cover'd under the pretence of the little Health which the Cardinal enjoy'd, which would not permit him to employ the greatest part of the Day in giving Audience to all who required it; because at that rate, he must spend the most part of the Night in the King's Affairs; and so could enjoy no repose: His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty intended thereby, that he should intend the Affairs of State only, without being distracted by other Businesses below him.</p>
               <p>During these Brouilleries of the Court, the Cardinal ceased not his care of Foreign Affairs. Though the Treaty of <hi>Monzon</hi> was concluded, yet it was not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; and the <hi>Grisons</hi> were so little satisfied, that it was not known what was to be done to bring it to execution; especially as to what regarded the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church-mens Goods; because the Bishop of <hi>Coire</hi> had been possessed of a great part of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which were in dispute; and they could not be taken away from those who were in possession, without making a great number of Malecontents. The exercise of <hi>Cavinism,</hi> which was forbidden in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> was no more a little Affair, because that way a great many <hi>Calvinist Grisons</hi> who had Lands, would be driven out. <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:187699:114"/> complained of the Delays which were made on both sides. The Marquis <hi>Mirabel</hi> above all complained, that one was to go seven or eight Leagues from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> to see the Cardinal; and that else it was in vain to speak with the other Ministers, who could do nothing without him. At last the two Crowns consented that the Affair should be treated at <hi>Rome,</hi> between the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors and the Pope's Ministers; and the Counts of <hi>Bethunes</hi> and <hi>Ogn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King approv'd of this Writing, but he gave Order to the Marquis <hi>de Coeuvres,</hi> before he put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, to regulate the Sum which those of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> were to pay yearly to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Troops necessary for the Preservation of that Country. <hi>Coeuvres</hi> did what he could to make an Agreement between the <hi>Grisons</hi> and those of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line;</hi> but the first would no way be brought to it, for fear that by treating with their Subjects they should seem to accept of the Treaty of <hi>Monzon.</hi> They believ'd themselves principally injur'd, in that it was permitted to those of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to chuse their Governours and Magistrates. But as at the bottom <hi>France</hi> took but little care of the Interests of the <hi>Grisons, Coeuvres</hi> had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to treat with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador about that Sum, which was regulated to twenty five thousand Crowns, by a Treaty signed the 22d of <hi>December,</hi> and ratified by the two Kings, and those of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> although the <hi>Grisons</hi> refus▪d to approve of it. Thus it is that the great Powers deal with the small ones, what they would call violating the Law of Nations, were it done to themselves.</p>
               <p>This same Year Ambassadors were sent to <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> to communicate to the Republick, and to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Treaty of <hi>Monzon;</hi> and as much as was possible, to appease them, <hi>Bullion</hi> was sent into <hi>Savoy,</hi> where he endeavour'd to appease <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> by representing to him, among other things, That the King had intended that he should have been compris'd in the Treaty of <hi>Monzon;</hi> and that it might be seen
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:187699:115"/> how great consideration his Majesty had for his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he was ready to allow to his House all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Titles it could desire. It was known that the Duke aspir'd to the Title of King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and they would amuse that Prince with this Chymerical Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, because they had nothing real to bestow on him. The Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> who last possess'd this Isle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it fell into the Hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> opposed it; which gave occasion to the Duke to take some time to think of it. <hi>Bullion</hi> treated also for a suspension of Arms between the Duke and the <hi>Genoese,</hi> and agreed to put the difference, which there was with this Republick, to the Judgment of some Arbitrators. It was propos'd to chuse for this some Counsellors of a Parliament of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Senate of <hi>Milan,</hi> or to refer themselves to the Emperour; but the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> accepted neither the one nor the other of these Parties. There were divers Negotiations thereupon during the rest of the Year, which came to no other end, only to make the Duke apprehend, that his interests were not over-dear to <hi>France.</hi>

His principal design was to get the <hi>Venetians</hi> to approve of the Treaty of <hi>Monzon;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Senate made sundry Remarks, as to the Interests of the King and the Confederates. <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi> having also offer'd the Republick to assure it a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage over the <hi>Valteline</hi> for ten Years, when their occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should require, and to make a League to shut it up to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> with the <hi>Swissers</hi> and <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> and even <hi>Savoy,</hi> if it would enter there: She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd but in general Terms to what regarded the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing; and she accepted the first with Pleasure, but she wished it had been for ever, or at least during the Life of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. The King intended, by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a writing this Passage of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> to remark, That it was to be without derogation to the Treaty of <hi>Monzon;</hi> but the Republick would not have any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a Treaty, in which she had no part; and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:187699:115"/> she desired farther, that the <hi>Grisons</hi> should ratifie the King's Promise. After some difficulties, <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi> agreed to what the Republick desired, by a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting signed the 21st of <hi>August</hi> 1626, and after appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the King. The Court of <hi>France</hi> nevertheless tried first to have it changed, in case it might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of the Commonwealth; but it being impossible to bend her, the King sent at last a Ratification pure and simple.</p>

                  <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> departing from <hi>Venice,</hi> took the way of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> there, with <hi>Coeuvres,</hi> to excuse the Treaty of <hi>Monzon;</hi> and the first thing which they did was to regulate what the Inhabitants of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline</hi> were to pay to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> which was reduc'd, as hath been said already, to twenty five Thousand Crowns.</p>

               <p>A while before <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> was departed for <hi>Swisser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with Orders to propose three things to the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons:</hi> The first was, That they should approve of the same Treaty.

The third was, That the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> should unite themselves with <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Grisons,</hi> to cause the Treaty to be observed, and to guard the Passages. At the instance of <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> a general Diet of all the <hi>Cantons</hi> and their Allies, was convoked at <hi>Soleu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re.</hi> He endeavour'd to perswade the Catholicks, that they had reason to approve of the Treaty, since by it the Catholick Religion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish'd in the <hi>Valteline;</hi> and the Protestants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Grisons</hi> were re-entred into the Possession of the Country.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Grisons</hi> had also sent one Deputy to the Diet, to oppose the approbation of the Treaty of <hi>Monzon,</hi> and to pray the <hi>Cantons</hi> to join some one of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Deputation, which they designed to send to <hi>Paris,</hi> to represent their Grievances to the King, which reduc'd themselves to these three Principals: 1. That the Protestant Religion was banished the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the neighbouring Countries: 2. That their Sovereignty was not well enough established by the Treaty: 3. That nothing was done without the Ratification of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> who for this might annul some Treaties which they had made with them.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:187699:116"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> answered on the Article of Religion, That they had innovated nothing in that, since the <hi>Grisons</hi> had agreed it by several Treaties; and that they were not to hinder the <hi>Calvinist Grisons</hi> from going into the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> about their Affairs: As for their Sovereignty, it was set on the same Foot on which it stood by the Treaty of <hi>Madrid;</hi> and if they lost any thing, that Loss was recompenced by a good Sum of Money. As to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Treaty which they requir'd, all the Treaties made since the Year 1617, were made void by the Articles of <hi>Monzon;</hi> and the King had given Order to his Ambassador in <hi>Spain,</hi> to labour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by means of his Catholick Majesty, that which they desired of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eight Catholick <hi>Cantons</hi> approved of the Treaty, such as it was; and the Protestants gave their Hands to all, except the Article which concerned Religion. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> return'd into <hi>France,</hi> not having found it to the purpose to press the second Article of his Instruction, and the third was full of difficulties: So the Affair of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was rather laid asleep than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, to the satisfaction of the <hi>Grisons;</hi> and there was none but the Catholick Inhabitants of that Country which inclin'd to the side of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who went off Gainers. As they were oblig'd to that of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> so they remain'd more addicted to <hi>Spain</hi> than to <hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>Grisons</hi> on the contrary were but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle satisfied with the <hi>French,</hi> who after vast Charges, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd not in the end to shut up the <hi>Valteline</hi> from the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> as will be seen by what follows. But the Brouilleries of the Court oblig'd the Cardinal to get out of this Affair readily at any rate whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>To return presently to what passed in <hi>France,</hi> the King having convoked an Assembly of Notables for the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> in the Year 1626. It was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the 2d of <hi>December,</hi> and ended the 24th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> in the Year following. Besides, the King, the Queen-Mother, and Monsieur, who was President, and assisted by the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Mareschals <hi>de la Force,</hi> and <hi>de Bassompierre,</hi> it was composed of the first and second President of the Parliament of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:187699:117"/>
                  <hi>Paris;</hi> of the first Presidents of the eight other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Kingdom; of the Procurators General; of the first and second Presidents of the Chambers of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Paris, Rouan</hi> and <hi>Dijon,</hi> with their Procurators General, and of those of the three Courts of Aids, of the Lieutenant-Civil of <hi>Paris,</hi> of six Knights of the Order of the Holy Ghost, of six of the Council, and of twelve Prelates. Before, the Custom was to convoke the States of that Kingdom, to treat of things which were to be propos'd: But the Cardinal, who knew that in the States many times more regard was had to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, than to the desires of the Ministers, would never convoke them. The Notables, who had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority but what the King was pleased to give them, never took any heed to oppose the Ministers; from whence that began to be call'd, <hi>The Good of the State;</hi> not what might contribute to the Happiness of the three Orders of the Kingdom, but what might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford means to the King, or rather to his Ministers, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Projects which they had proposed to themselves. The Nobility, nor the third State, not any more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Body, and the Clergy not assembling themselves, but under the good Pleasure of the King or his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, no complaint could any more be made of the Government, without appearing seditious, and being presently ruined by the Authority of those who were blamed; because no particular person could say that he had power to speak in the Name of any one whatsoever, or to support himself on the Authority of a politick Assembly, since there was now no such thing. The Kings were become absolute Masters of the Laws, and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters were in capacity to take away all sorts of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and ancient Customs, to do what they thought fit. It is for the Politicians to see whether it be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that there should be a Power in the State, which may do all things without punishment, and dare eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, as it never fails to happen; or which is better, if there should be no power but what is limited by the Law, and which dare undertake nothing but what is conformable to it. Some Persons believe, that an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority without Bounds, prevents all sorts of disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But should this be, there would be a great many
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:187699:117"/> Questions to be made about this Matter: as, Whether it were better for a whole Kingdom, and even for all Mankind, to live in an eternal Slavery, under a few Persons, subject to very great defects, because it is in their power to do all things: or to be sometimes distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with Civil Wars, which end at last, and leave to the people great intervals of Tranquility? It may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be demanded, If the unlimited Power of a Monarch be more advantageous to him than an Authority boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by equitable Laws; because we often see that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of that sort, in which the Princes, without restraint, indulge their Desires, spend themselves so fast, that besides the infinite Miseries, which their Subjects suffer in time of Peace, they are unable to repulse their Enemies in time of War. I say nothing of Justice and Equity, which are seldom the Products of Despotick Power; and I speak as little of the Gospel, which the Ministers of Princes hear much less than the people; I only ask, if it be advatageous to persons brought up in pleasure, infinitely full of violent Passions, and drunk with perpetual Flatteries, to see nothing to contradict their Desires? I demand further, if after some Reigns of this nature, Posterity hath reason to bless the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of those who laid the Foundations of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Authority? These indeed are Questions which the Designs I have proposed to my self, will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to resolve, and which the Readers may examine if they find it to their purpose. I come presently to what pass'd in the Assembly of Notables, which I will relate more at length, that it may be known, what the State of the Kingdom was when the Cardinal undertook the Administration of Affairs.</p>

The King told them, That he had assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to remedy the disorders of the State, and that the Keeper of the Seals should more fully declare his Pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marillac</hi> begun to say, that the King had convok'd them to have their Advice in the great and important Affairs of the State, in imitation of his Predecessors, who sometimes assembled the three Estates, sometimes notable Persons
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:187699:118"/> of a fewer number. He after put himself upon the Praises of the King, and the Favour which God had shew'd him, to discover divers Conspiracies formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Authority; which he had re-established on their Ruins. After this he represented, that the Civil Wars, since the year 1620 had consum'd vast Sums, and that it had been farther necessary to succour the Allies of the State out of the Kingdom. That the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revenue of the King not exceeding sixteen Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Livres, he had been obliged in the last Years to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend between thirty six and forty Millions, of which part had been rais'd by several ways, but that he owed yet more than fifty: That for this he was resolv'd to retrench his unnecessary Expences; and that he had already suppress'd the Offices of Constable and Admiral, the Salaries whereof amounted to no less than five hundred thousand Livres yearly: That he would demolish all the useless Fortifications, to withdraw the Garrisons which were to keep them: That he would redeem his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesnes engag'd at a low Rate, as well as the Tallies and Farm of Salt: That to augment the Revenues of the State, he would endeavour to make Trade flourish, which the Neighbours had wholly drawn away to themselves. Lastly, the Keeper insisted on two Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which requir'd new Regulations; the one was the ill administration of the Revenue, and the other, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Rebellions.</p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> spoke after <hi>Marillac,</hi> and amongst other things said, That the King would have always on foot thirty thousand Men well paid; and that he had given him Memorials how to find ways to desray that Charge, which he would communicate to the Assembly.</p>
               <p>When he had ended his Speech, the Cardinal <hi>de Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> began, and discuss'd the same things with the Keeper; to which he added, That there wanted not only many Ordinances to bring things into Order, but also for the good execution of such Acts as should be made: That the Redemption of the King's Demesnes, of the Aids, and of the Registers, came to about two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but innocent ways were to be used to raise them: That he designed to labour incessantly to redress all the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:187699:118"/> Affairs of the Crown; and if he could accomplish so good and so glorious a design, he should die with joy after it, and believe he had great Reason to give thanks to God.</p>
               <p>The first President of <hi>Paris</hi> spoke after the Cardinal, and enlarged himself much on the Praises of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. He exhorted the Assembly not to be mute, as others had been, and ended with Praises to God that he will bestow Children on the King.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Keeper of the Seals said, That the King would send his Propositions to the Assembly by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator-General of the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> Thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the opening of this Assembly, where all were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Although it was permitted to the Notables to seek out Remedies for the Disorders proposed to them, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done but under the good Pleasure of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who would that the Assembly should authorize their Conduct, and not censure it as the States might have done. There was read a Memorial, which was said to be compos'd by the Marquis <hi>d'Effiat.</hi> See an Abridgment of its Contents.</p>
               <p>It was there said, That although there never had been a King under whom the Treasury was so well managed as under <hi>Henry</hi> IV. yet were the Financers then often found to fall short, were it because of Expences which they had not taken notice of; or because of the Abatements of the Farms, by reason of Barrenness or Mortalities, which produced want of value in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Receipts; or because of the extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences which must be sometimes made: That there was no Year, in the midst of a Peace, wherein the Expence did not surpass the estimation made of it by five or six Millions of Livres: That <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, because of this, made his Expence less than his Receit by four or five Millions, beside what he caus'd to be laid aside of the whole Years Management out of the Moneys destin'd for his ordinary Expences, or which came into his Coffers by extraordinary ways: That from thence it came, that during the last ten Years of his Reign, he had laid by seven Millions, which were
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:187699:119"/> sound in the <hi>Bastile,</hi> and in the Hands of the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer at his death: That after his death they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to balance the Expences to the Receit; and that in a little time, as they found themselves in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rear; they were forc'd to touch the Treasure; and this way they went until the Year 1613. That afterwards the Expences which encreased, caused them to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to sundry Creations of Offices; and with all this they were fain to engage the Revenues of the Years following: That they could scarcely pay the Interest to those who had advanced Money, which was the cause that they acquitted themselves of their Charges as they pleased: That the Farmers and their Partisans had drawn the Interest of their Money to fifteen, eighteen, and twenty <hi>per Cent,</hi> and never gave up an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. That all being in disorder, it was no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Superintendant of the Finances to see all the Accompts which are not yet stated, and to reduce those who detained the King's Money to be accountable for it. That the Constable and the Admiral, whose Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys were suppressed, had been the cause of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Expences, because they never gave an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>That the State of the Treasury was to be remitted to that of the Year 1608. in which the Queen-Mother had caused to be remitted by the King three Millions of Livres, on the Taxes, and on the Impositions, and took away divers Taxes which burthen'd the People: That afterwards the King was obliged to treble the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and to give three hundred thousand Livres to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and two hundred thousand to the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> besides a quantity of others, which came to five Millions of Livres.</p>
               <p>That the Tallies yearly amounted to near nineteen Millions; but there came but six to the Treasury, the rest remained in the Hands of two and twenty thousand Collectors, and of one hundred and seventy private, or general Receivers, who carried them to the Treasury: That the general Farm of the <hi>Gabelles</hi> was seven Millions four hundred thousand Livres, and that the Charges of it was two Millions: That there were six Millions and three hundred thousand Livres alienated, and that there
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:187699:119"/> remain'd to the King but one Million and one hundred thousand Livres: That there was the like Alienation on the Rent of Aids; of which the Farm was near two Millions: That, in fine, the two thirds of the Revenue of the other Farms, were hardly sufficient to defray the Charges of them.</p>
               <p>In the sequel, the Marquis <hi>de Effiat</hi> made an Account of all the Expences which were to be made, after it was entred in charge, and which arose much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Receit. There was no way found to provide Money readily, but the creation of a number of new Offices, and the establishment of divers Charges on the Titles of Offices. Besides this, divers Customs were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished which were not before. These were the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to which the Convocation of the Notables principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tended, and upon them the Ministers were willing to discharge the hatred which the new Impositions might draw upon them.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> was but twice in this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, at the opening of it, as I said, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>January</hi> 11. <hi>Aubery.</hi> Lib. 2. c. 9.</note> and six Weeks afterwards. He took his place in a Chair near to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur, and below the Cardinal <hi>de al Valette.</hi> He there presented divers Articles, which the Register read; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Cardinal spoke, and explained them at length. In the first Article was proposed, to moderate the Penalties against Offenders of the State, and to be contented with depriving them of their Charges for the second Disobedience. The Assembly could not digest this Moderation, and concluded to request the King, That the ancient Laws might be executed against Criminals. The Cardinal having always held it for a Maxim to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don none who were accused of Crimes against the State, it may be thought, that he only proposed this excessive Moderation, on purpose that the Assembly might reject it; which to be sure it would, to shew its Zeal for the Royal Authority. Some others regarded the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by Sea and Land, which were to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>English,</hi> who threatned a new Rupture in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> All that the Ministers would have, was approved of without any consideration of the Expence.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:187699:120"/>
               <p> Whereas to raise Money readily, they had for many years past, sold almost all the Charges and Offices both of the Court and Army, and of the Tribunals of Justice; and those who were the first Buyers, had liberty to sell them again: No body came thither without ready Money; which caused that no regard was had neither to the Quality, nor the merit of those who presented themselves; and the poor Nobility were quite out of probability to advance themselves *.

               <p>For answer to this Petition, and to hinder the Alarm which might be taken of the new Projects for War, of which the Kingdom was full against the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers,</hi> the King gave a Declaration, dated the 16th. of * <hi>February;</hi> in which, after notice taken, that the Design <note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. To reunite his Subjects in the Unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, <hi>by all the good ways of Sweetness, of Love, of Patience, and good Examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To re-establish the Dignity of the Church, by the exact Observation of the Ecclesiastical Constitutions and Royal Ordinances relating thereto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To maintain his Subjects of the pretended Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, in all the Liberty which he had granted to them, causing them to enjoy their Goods quietly, and their Offices, by the Benefit of the Edicts, and Favours which they had obtain'd from him, in expectation that it would please God to illuminate their Hearts, and bring them back into the Bosom of his Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To advance the Nobility with many Favours and Privileges, for their entrance into Benefices, in the Charges and Offices as well of his Majesty's Houshold, as of his Armies, according as they should render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves capable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To cause the Children of poor Gentlemen to be instructed <hi>gratis,</hi> in Exercises befitting their Condition;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:187699:120"/> and to employ those of that Order both at Sea and Land, that their Condition should be worthy of Envy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To re-establish Commerce, and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and augment its Privileges.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To comfort his People, by easing them of Three millions of Livres for the next five Years, comprehending therein the Six hundred thousand Livres, of which they had been discharged in the Year 1627. so that they should find themselves entirely eased in the Year 1632.</p>
               <p>The evil is, that in giving on one side, there is a taking on the other; and nothing of all this was put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but what the Minister found for his purpose. There was a great deal of talk of re-establishing the Commerce at Sea, of which the King made the Cardinal of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> Superintendant: but he needed but have left this Affair to the Industry of private Persons, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater and more active, than that of a Minister who understands nothing of it, and who hath innumerable other Affairs. So that this Project produced no great fruit, no more than many others which were publish'd under the Administration of the Cardinal to amuse the People, which was otherways drawn out by unprofitable Wars.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Assembly of the Notables, having compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed various Articles on the Propositions which were there made, was broke up the 24th. of <hi>February,</hi> and had such Respect (for its Advice) as it pleased the Council to give.</p>
               <p>The King, after he had dissolv'd the Office of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which was enjoy'd by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> gave one part of his Functions to the Cardinal of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi>

He caus'd the Queen-mother to be told, That he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her not to think of marrying of Monsieur suddenly; and gave Orders to <hi>Puilaurens</hi> and <hi>le Coigneux,</hi> in whom that Prince plac'd his greatest Confidence, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously to divert him from it, by proposing to him all sorts of Pleasures, for which they furnish'd him with all the Money he could desire. They bought also <hi>Limours</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> for him to divert himself there with Hunting. But the Queen-Mother, who found the King would never have Children, thought the sooner to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Monsieur to one of the Daughters of the Great Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> over whom she might have the greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in case she should ever come to be Queen. This Design was extraordinarily controverted, and also was the cause of the removal of the Queen-Mother, as you will find by the sequel. I must at present speak of the defence of the Isle of <hi>Rhée;</hi> after which, I will come to those Treaties which concern'd this Marriage, and the foreign Affairs.</p>
               <p>Before the King fell sick, he nam'd the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> Lieutenant-General of his Armies, and under him the Mareschals <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> and <hi>Schomberg.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen sick, as I have said, and yet keeping his Bed, news came to the Court, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri,</hi> ibid. p. 280.</note> that the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had made a Descent on the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> maugre <hi>Thoiras,</hi> who, after he had three times repulsed the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> was at last constrain'd to retreat into the Fort of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> which was but ill provided to endure a Siege. A great number of Men were lost on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and the Cannon of the <hi>English</hi> Ships made a great havock on <hi>Thoiras,</hi> who was there wounded, and lost two of his Brothers. At the same time <hi>Buckingham</hi> sent six Ships of War to cruize at the mouth of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and as many to that of the <hi>Loyre,</hi> to prohibit all Vessels from coming out of those Rivers, and to keep divers Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in alarms. It was not fit to let the King know this, lest it should augment his Distemper. They after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with some things; but hid from him the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:187699:122"/> danger of the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> which they concluded they could not keep. <hi>Buckingham</hi> came with Twenty six Ships, and had set eight thousand Men on shoar; who after they had beaten <hi>Thoiras</hi> at their landing, went to besiege the Fort of St. <hi>Martin.</hi> In the interim, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur impatiently desired to be at the head of the Army, of which he had been declar'd Lieutenant-General. The Cardinal told him, That he could not advise the King, sick as he was, to suffer it. But the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was so enrag'd at this Refusal, that it was impossible to detain him any longer. But as they had long since rais'd great Jealousies in the King, for every thing that might be to the advantage of his Brother, it was not difficult for the Cardinal, who took care to blow those Coals of Jealousie, to re-call him. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> received that news at <hi>Saumur;</hi> but a little after the Queen-Mother, who was angry at this usage of Monsieur, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of the King, that he should proceed on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and he came to <hi>Poitou,</hi> where the Army was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Aube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Life of the Cardinal, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note>. In the mean time, the Cardinal neglected not to send Victuals and Relief into the Isle of <hi>Rhée;</hi> but all his Cares had been vain, had <hi>Thoiras</hi> been less brave, or had the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> known how to attack a Place. The Cardinal had for some time been Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Oleron</hi> and of <hi>Brouage,</hi> which Governments were of little profit to him; but he had desired them to have some Place of retreat, in case new <hi>Brouilleries</hi> should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at Court, and he found himself not the strongest there. He then made the Garrisons be doubled, and paid them their Arrears out of his own Money, that he might encourage and dispose them to act more vigorously in whatsoever he should employ them. He also got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a considerable number of Barques with Oars, to carry Succours and Victuals to the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> as soon as was possible.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> a few days after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, publish'd a <hi>Manifesto,</hi> dated <hi>July</hi> 21. not only to excuse his Design in respect of <hi>France,</hi> but also to make the <hi>English</hi> believe, that pure Zeal of Religion had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the King of <hi>England</hi> to this Action <note n="*" place="margin">Sequel of the Rebellion. <hi>p.</hi> 612.</note>. He said, That the desire the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Reformed Religion, had engaged him to seek
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:187699:123"/> for the Sister of <hi>France,</hi> that he might be in the better state to support the Reformed <hi>French:</hi> That becoming as it were Mediator and Guarrantee of the last Treaty of Peace, he could not behold, without complaint, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traventions of the <hi>French</hi> King's Ministers, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal they had made to do Justice to those of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, and to him, and because of the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives made against <hi>Rochelle,</hi> he thought himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd speedily to take Arms to relieve it: That by the Word they had often given him, to satisfie those of the Reformed Religion, in due time, and when they had rendred themselves worthy by their Submissions, he had always understood the demolishing of <hi>Fort-Louis;</hi> and that instead of pulling it down, they had augmented its Fortifications, and also made other Forts in the Isle of <hi>Rhée.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Court had never acknowledged the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for Mediator and Guarrantee of the Peace: But it was true, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mem.</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> at the end.</note> that his Ambassadors had promised the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> to cause it to be observ'd. It was also certain, that instead of letting them enjoy their Privileges, they sought to quarrel with them, and prepared to ruine them on the first Opportunity: Although it was publickly denied, it was confess'd in private; and the event hath proved, that they had reason to complain. This <hi>Manifesto</hi> was not absolutely false, though the Partisans of the Court said so.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was to form the Body of an Army in <hi>Poitou,</hi> at the same time that they should hear that the <hi>English</hi> were landed in the Isle of <hi>Rhée.</hi> He also publish'd a <hi>Manifesto</hi> to excite the People to take Arms, principally founded on the Courts not having observed the Treaty of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> although the King had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd it. This <hi>Manifesto</hi> had not all the Effect the Duke expected, because a number of <hi>Hugonot</hi> Nobility had for a long time oppos'd it; and this was one of the principal causes of the ruin of the Party. Had it been perfectly united, or had it employ'd all its force that way, it would not have been too strong to resist the Court's Undertakings; but being divided, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to conserve its Advantages. Those who were against the Duke, call'd him Disturber, and accus'd him
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:187699:123"/> of Cheating and Cowardice, since they feign'd not to see how the Court sought to destroy the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; or else being convinced of it, they durst not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. Without searching which of them were in the right, it is certain, that if all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had been of the mind to abandon themselves entirely to the Good Faith of the Court and the King's Equity, and the Court had been assur'd thereof, it would not have been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had been stripp'd of all their Privileges, and constrain'd to go to Mass. The Ecclesiasticks always made a Vertue of this; and the Interest of the Laicks, which made them seek their Favour, or the Zeal which possess'd them, defac'd in their Spirits all that which is call'd Sweetness and Equity in Religion. If at any time they have been restrain'd on this occasion, it was because they thought they could not ruin the Hereticks without punishment; and they never fail'd to do it when they could. The Duke not having been able to get many Men together in <hi>Poitou,</hi> because of the King's Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where he rased several Towns. But the Court sent the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> thither, to oppose his Designs; and <hi>Galland,</hi> Councellor of State and a <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot,</hi> to divert the People of the same Religion from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arms.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who instead of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Art and Force for taking the Fort (into which <hi>Thoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> was retreated) before it could be relieved, he thought to starve it, yet without absolutely blocking it up, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himself with keeping a good Guard, that nothing might enter. It was nevertheless easie to judge that <hi>France</hi> would try all ways to succour <hi>Thoiras,</hi> if time permitted it; and that in a few Weeks the neighbouring Coasts would be cover'd with People, and Boats ready to throw Men and Provisions into the Fort. It was also dangerous for the Great Ships of <hi>England</hi> to pass the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn on Coasts full of Banks and Shoals. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, two Months pass'd without the <hi>English</hi>'s doing any thing considerable to carry the Cittadel, which resisted them, nor could they hinder little Barks from entring it daily.</p>

They grounded their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the King's not having Forces enough to do both at once. But the Cardinal was of <hi>Thoiras</hi>'s Opinion, and represented, That in a little time the King would have Forces enough to guard the Posts which he had about <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and to undertake what was propos'd: That by withdrawing the Troops which were in the Isle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and joining two thousand Men of the Army Commanded by Monsieur, they might throw Five or six thousand Foot, and Five hundred Horse into the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> which, join'd with the Garrison of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> would be enough to beat out the <hi>English:</hi> That it was greatly important to the King to preserve this Isle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if the Enemy should become Masters of it, that of <hi>Oleron</hi> would quickly fall into their hands: That by means of these Two Islands, they would keep the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Coasts in continual Alarms: That they would draw great quantities of Money from the Vines, the Corn, and the Salt of <hi>Rhée</hi> and <hi>Oleron:</hi> That they would not only hinder the transport of Salt from <hi>Brouage, Marennes,</hi> and the neighbouring Coasts, but would extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Trade of <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> That, finally, what good success they should have in the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> would infallibly be follow'd by very ill Effects through the Kingdom. These Reasons were strong enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, had they not been supported by the Authority of the Cardinal, to make the Council give ear to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Thoiras:</hi> Wherefore they resolv'd to attempt the relief of <hi>Rhée,</hi> by embarking the number of Troops which the Cardinal spoke of, if they could find Barques fit for it on the Coasts of the Ocean. <note n="*" place="margin">

But there was little appearance that the King had so little Credit, as not presently to find ready Money necessary for the Payment of those Barques; and if the Cardinal advanced any of his own, it was more for Ostentation than Necessity. His vain and ambitious Nature induced him always to what might make the greatest noise in the World, and beget in the People the more admiration of him.</p>

               <p>The Succours which they had resolv'd to throw into the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> were not ready till the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> although the Cardinal had sent Persons a long time before, to gather up a convenient number of Barques and Shallops, and was himself at the Places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Month of <hi>October.</hi> At last Six thousand Foot and Three hundred Horse of the best of the Army, landed in the night, between the 5th. and 6th. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> conducted by the Mareschal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac,</hi> Brother to the Keeper of the Seals. The Great Ships of the <hi>English</hi> not being capable of coming near, were fain to shoot at a distance at those which pass'd, but they kill'd very few; and when the <hi>French</hi> were landed over-against the Fort of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> they entrench'd themselves. The next morning the <hi>French</hi> Army put it self in Battel-aray, to attack the <hi>English</hi> in their Intrenchments, in case they would not come out; but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> met them; and after a Fight, <note n="*" place="margin">

They had lost a great number on this occasion, if the night, which was come on, had not stopp'd the <hi>French,</hi> who pursued them. When <hi>Thoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> saw the Trenches almost deserted, he made a Sally with Eight hundred Men, who routed those the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had left therein. All who could recover the Fleet, embark'd with the rest, and set sail for <hi>England.</hi> It was thus that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who had far more Ambition than Ability, was shamefully driven out of the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> after he had three Months besieg'd a Fort, which before a well-commanded Army would not have held out eight days. He by this means ruin'd the Affairs of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> a great part of whose Provisions he consum'd, without supplying them again, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd them to surrender the Year following.</p>
               <p>After this Victory, the Blockade of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on the Land-side, and the Court thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this City the Campagne ensuing; for this they not only block'd it up more straitly than before, but as the <hi>English</hi> were chiefly to be fear'd, because they had no Fleet to make head against theirs, all ways were sought to appease them. The King began to send back the <hi>English</hi> Prisoners of War without Ransom, who had been taken in the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> he having first given Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for their good Usage. Pretence was made that they were treated so well, in favour of the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and the King wrote to her by <hi>de Meaux,</hi> whom he sent to <hi>London,</hi> as to reconduct the Prisoners. He had Orders at the same time to address himself to the Ambassadors of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who had already offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Mediators between the Two Crowns, and to see if by any Treaty an Accommodation might be made. The <hi>English</hi> Prisoners being arriv'd at <hi>London,</hi> publish'd the most obliging manner they had been treated by the <hi>French;</hi> and <hi>de Meaux</hi> executed his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Prisoners favouring him in all they could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>

They concluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching the King, That whatever Propositions should be made, the Preparations should be carried on with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; and above all a Convoy of Men and Victuals, which were presently to be sent to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> which by the Care of the Admiral the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ready. The King of <hi>England</hi> slighted not the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> but being far from seriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to conserve <hi>Calvinism</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> he had a design in his Head to give more liberty to the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> he made not the haste as he might have done, although he was press'd by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> piqued at the Affront which he had so lately receiv'd at

               <p>In the mean time the King and the Cardinal stay'd before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and caused new Forts to be made to block it up the closer.

The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> had two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of which either would have fitted the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was the eldest, was already affianced to <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> was too young, and besides so ugly, that when they proposed her to Monsieur, he declared he would have none of her. He would have taken <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was beautiful, and of an Age fit for Marriage, if the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> would have given place to it. The Queen-Mother passionately desired it, and managed things so as the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Marriage was put off for a time, to see if they could get him to be contented with <hi>Ann</hi> instead of <hi>Margaret,</hi> which the Grand Duke would have given to Monsieur. But all that she could do could not prevail with the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to forego <hi>Margaret,</hi> nor the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to espouse <hi>Ann;</hi> which was a great grief to a Mother am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and fearful to extremity. She dreaded the Life of the King, who much tired himself with hunting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard of heat or cold, and who was of no good Complexion, being too dry and too lean. Moreover that Princess, bewitched with judiciary Astrology, had heard <hi>Fabbroni,</hi> Steward to Madam deceas'd, say, that the King should live thirty Years, and that in his eight and twentieth he should be in great danger. This made her desire to see <hi>Gaston</hi> soon married, and that to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess who would have a respect for her; and she desired
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:187699:127"/> it the more passionately, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 264.</note> because this Prince being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd, made no scruple to go every night to infamous places, and had sometime got foul Diseases, which might in time wholly ruin his Health. And when the King, who abstained from that Vice, reprehended him, <hi>Gaston</hi> would answer, That if they would have him abstain, they must marry him.</p>
               <p>Also the Queen-Mother endeavour'd it always, but could not hit it, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. p</hi> 267.</note> because neither the King, the Queen, nor the Cardinal, in earnest favour'd the Design, though they made semblance of the contrary. The old Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of the King to his Brother, made him desire he should not suddenly marry; and the Party of <hi>Florence</hi> which would have encreased the Queen-Mother's Authority, pleased him not at all. The Queen, whom <hi>Mary</hi> kept as much down as she could, already groaned too much under her Authority to desire an Augmentation. The Cardinal himself, though that Princesses Creature, would have been troubled to see Monsieur married, and to have had many Children; because the more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Prince should be, the more would the Minister, who never was one of his Friends, lose his Authority: Besides, this Prelate, who begun to govern all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent from the Queen-Mother, and who could not patiently suffer any contradiction, was already vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Respects which he was obliged to pay her.</p>
               <p>There was then at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> a young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, seventeen Years of Age, Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> but of such Health as promised not much fruitfulness; and besides, that the Queen-Mother loved not this branch of the House of <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> allied to the Princes of the Blood, and who had always been of a Party adverse to her. Her Kindred dealt so, that Monsieur saw her often, and falling in love with her, he said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that he would not marry; and at other times, that he would never marry any other Princess but <hi>Mary de Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga.</hi> This extreamly perplexed the Queen-Mother, and created <note n="*" place="margin">See them in <hi>Siri,</hi> T. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 265. &amp;c.</note> so many Intrigues in this Affair, that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> would not resign <hi>Margaretde Medicis</hi> to Monsieur, and that the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> refused absolutely to marry her younger Sister, maugre all the instances of <hi>Mary;</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:187699:127"/> and that she was absolutely dissatisfied at his espousal of <hi>Madamoiselle de Nevers,</hi> I will not detain you with the Particularities of these Affairs, because they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly relate to the Life of the Cardinal; but what I shall now set down, will, in the sequel, be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as you will see by the History of the succeeding Years.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendôme,</hi> who was put in the <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> as I have told you, protested always his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence in relation to the Designs against the King, which were laid to his charge; but he could not deny <note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>May Siri</hi> T. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 217. 252.</note>, at least, that he had enterprized against the Authority of the Minister; so that he was to demand pardon of the King, and to renounce the Government of <hi>Bretaigne.</hi> Thereupon the King dispatched him his Letters of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, and pardoned his Life, but refused him his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though he permitted his Friends to see him at the <hi>Bois de Vincennes.</hi> But for the Grand Prior, who would not do the like, he had not the like Favour, and no Person was admitted to see him.</p>
               <p>In the interim, the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> as you have seen, was departed the Kingdom, and ceased not to feel at that distance the anger of the Cardinal. The <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri.</hi> ibid. p. 210.</note> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess of <hi>Soissons</hi> sharply complained to Father <hi>Berule,</hi> that they had affirm'd, that there were Letters from her Son, in which he had advised Monsieur to retreat to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and she begged to see those Letters. Father <hi>Berule</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cardinal, related this for answer to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess, That the Ministers of the King were not obliged to justifie what they had said, because they might have spoken it for the good of the State, and that the King knew the Truth of all. However he denied that he had spoken of any such Letters; although the Countess maintained, that she heard it from a Person of the greatest Quality. She also said, That the Cardinal had told, that a Gentleman of the Counts Retinue, had staid some time at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> by order of his Master, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. The Count and the Gentleman both vented themselves against this Calumny. But the Cardinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied he had said it, although he confessed that he might perhaps have declared to some or other his Suspicion of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:187699:128"/> such a matter. It sufficed him that he had so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarm'd the King as to grant him Guards.</p>
               <p>The Count having designed to see <hi>Italy,</hi> the Cardinal had taken care to recommend him thither, as he thought best for his purpose. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri,</hi> ibid. p. 305.</note> He writ to the Count <hi>de Bethunes,</hi> to entertain him seldom, thinking that the other Ambassadors would follow the Example of the <hi>French,</hi> and so he would be coldly received by all he should visit. But the Count <hi>de Bethunes,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd not himself with the Ministers Passion, and who believ'd it consisted not with the King's Honour, to cause a Prince of his Blood to be ill treated out of his States, received him into his House, although he would not have the Complaisance to sit below him at the Table, as that Prince had desired. The Cardinal was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly provoked, that the Count <hi>de Bethunes</hi> had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served his Orders; for he could not endure to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by halfs; and he was so tenacious to his own Opinions, that to contradict him, was to disoblige him: So that <hi>Bethunes</hi> had much ado to appease him, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to him many strong Reasons he had to treat the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> after that manner.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>Scaglia</hi> also, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri ibid.</hi> p. 212, &amp;c.</note> at the same time, felt the effects of the Cardinal's displeasure, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him, by talking too hotly against the Treaty of <hi>Monzon.</hi> This witty Prelate, being willing to have him recalled, accused him to have been of the Cabal with <hi>Chalais,</hi> and to have treated with the grand Prior, and offered on the behalf of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assistance of Forces. The Abbot absolutely denied it, and endeavour'd to justifie himself in several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which he had with the Cardinal, and with the other Ministers: But as this was not his Transaction, he was told, That he should himself beg his Master to recall him; and that in such a case, they would give him Testimonials as he pleased, of his Innocence; and, in fine, he was obliged to accept of the Ambassage into <hi>Flanders:</hi> After which the Cardinal did him all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Civilities.</p>

And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> suspected on their side, that the <hi>French</hi> had no other design, than to fright the <hi>English</hi> to an accommodation, and so the Fleet which they had promised, never appear'd; and so the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had opportunity to make the Descent on the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> of which I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

Siri</hi> T. 6. p. 302, &amp;c.</note> the death of <hi>Vincent,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> was the occasion of a Broil between the two Crowns, and, in effect, the cause of a Rupture which after happened. The King of <hi>France</hi> had received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice before, that <hi>Vincent</hi> was visited with a Sickness, which would not permit him to live long, and had prevailed with this Prince, that the Duke of <hi>Rethel,</hi> eldest Son of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> should go to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to reside there. The Estates of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> after the death of <hi>Vincent,</hi> were to belong to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who had no Children. But as <hi>Mantua</hi> was an Imperial Feif, and Neighbour to the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> favoured <hi>Caesar de Gonzaga,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guastalla,</hi> and had prevailed with the Emperour to give him the Investiture of that Dutchy. The Count of <hi>Strigio,</hi> in whom <hi>Vincent</hi> placed a great confidence, and who was <hi>French</hi> by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, had induced that Prince, not only to receive the Duke of <hi>Rethel,</hi> but also to prevent all disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to grant him <hi>Mary de Mantua</hi> his Niece; who for want of Heirs Male might pretend to the Inheritance of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> The King thereupon sent the Marquiss <hi>de St. Chamond</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to inform himself of the Rights which he might have in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give him some satisfaction, lest he should
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:187699:129"/> enterprise any thing on that Estate: He gave not opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Emperour to seize it, under pretext of the Rights of the Duke <hi>de Guastalla,</hi> in a time when <hi>France,</hi> busied with the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> would not be in estate to relieve it.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Chamond</hi> also had Orders to go to <hi>Mantua;</hi> and as soon as he came to <hi>Cazal,</hi> he heard that Duke <hi>Vincent</hi> was grown worse. Entring into <hi>Mantua,</hi> he found that <hi>Strigio</hi> had done all that could be desired of him, to procure the Succession to fall into the Hands of the Duke of <hi>Nevers.</hi> Duke <hi>Vincent</hi> following his Counsel, had declared by Letters Patents, and by his Will, the Duke of <hi>Rethel</hi> General of his Troops; and the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> through his Hands, were to take an Oath of Fidelity to the Duke of <hi>Nevers.</hi> At the same time it was discover'd that the Duke <hi>de Guastalla</hi> had some design upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and five <hi>Petards</hi> were found in his House, which were seized with some of his Domesticks, who were put in Prison. They wrote presently to the Emperour, that they might be qualified, to refuse to acknowledge the Duke, in case he should make use of his Commission of Vicar of the Empire. The Duke of <hi>Rethel</hi> also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched a Courier to <hi>France</hi> to his Father the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> to pray him to come away incessantly, if he intended to take possession of his Estates.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the eldest Son of the Duke <hi>de Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalla,</hi> requested at <hi>Milan</hi> assistance from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after he had shew'd to the Governour and the Senate the Investiture which the Emperour had granted him: They promised to assist him, and presently dispatched <hi>John Serbellon</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to maintain his Interest. In stead of admitting him forthwith into the City, they shut the Gates for a whole Day against him, before they would hear any thing he had to propose, under pretext that they would receive him with greater Ceremony. He could not enter till the 24th of <hi>December,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Rethel</hi> had nothing left undone, but to take the Oaths of the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> and to marry the Princess <hi>Mary.</hi> Also the night following they brought that Princess out of the Convent where she was, to the Palace, to espouse the Prince of <hi>Rethel,</hi> and consummate the Marriage with him. Some say, that <hi>Vincent</hi> before he died, having

               <p>On the morrow morning the Prince of <hi>Rethel,</hi> who then assumed the Title of Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> sent <hi>Strigio</hi> to Count <hi>Serbellon,</hi> to pay him Respects on his behalf, and to tell him, that the Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the Princess his Wife, expected him to condole with them for the death of Prince <hi>Vincent.</hi> No sooner did <hi>Serbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> hear <hi>Strigio</hi> talk after this manner, but he went out of his Lodging in the Palace, and retired into an Inn.

It was answer'd him, That the Prince of <hi>Mantua</hi> valued not his Approbation; That he depended on none but God; and that he would live under no Protection, but of the most Christian King. <hi>Serbellon</hi> instantly retir'd to <hi>Milan;</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> Ambassador of <hi>Savoy,</hi> went away at the same time without taking leave. Thus did <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat</hi> change Masters, without any violence. But it was not so easie for the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> to keep them, as it was to get them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Possession.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things passed in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Cardinal dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1628"/> labour'd more to block up the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> and as it was but in vain to close them up from Communication with the Neighbourhood at Land, whilst their Haven was open, he sought also ways to shut up that. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

At last the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal propos'd to make a Dutch of Stone, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it leave a Passage for the Tide. They begun this
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:187699:130"/> Work at one side of the Gulf, which made the Harbour of <hi>Rochelle</hi> of seven hundred and forty Fathom breadth, where the Cannon of <hi>Rochelle</hi> could not reach: To frame this Fence, they drove into the Sea great Piles, from ten to twelve Feet, and traversed them with others, and put Stones into them, which had no other cement than what the Surges of the Sea cast in. They also sunk several Vessels loaden with Stones to support them. It was at the bottom twelve Fathom wide, and went sloping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top, where it was but four. Its heighth was above the highest Tides; so that the Soldiers they put upon it to guard it were always dry: There were also many Ships to defend it within and without, and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery on both the Banks.</p>
               <p>The besieged believed that this Work would never be ended, because the Sea many times took away all that they had placed; and it is true, that had they had Victuals for some Weeks more, or had the <hi>English</hi> but done their best, the Wind, or the shock of some Vessels, would have overthrown this Fence, of which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal so much boasted, and for which he had been laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, if the <hi>Rochellers</hi> could have held out any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Whilst they worked at the Fence D. <hi>Frederick de Toledo</hi> arriv'd with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, which was but ill equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, besides a Storm had much endamag'd it. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Leganez</hi> and <hi>de Spinola</hi> came thither also; and the King order'd all the Works to be shewn to this last; some of which, concerning whom the King asked his Advice, he disliked. He said, amongst other things, That there were but two ways to take <hi>Rochelle;</hi> which was, <hi>to close the Haven, or to open the Purse.</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal honoured him very much, and, because of his Age, called him Father. When he came into <hi>Spain,</hi> far from approving the management of the Count-Duke, who had caused the Fleet to be sent to assist the King of <hi>France</hi> to take <hi>Rochelle,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Siri,</hi> T. 6. p. 358.</note> he counsell'd the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to assist the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> and always when Discourse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with him upon any design, he fell back upon this; he judged that <hi>Spain</hi> sinned against the chief Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of good Policy, in aiding the King of <hi>France</hi> to render himself absolute Master of his Estates: And this
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:187699:130"/> Conduct was by so much the more ridiculous, since the <hi>French</hi> had just then concluded a League with the States of the United Provinces, to help to maintain them against the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Cardinal was happy, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Administration <hi>Spain</hi> was governed by the Count <hi>d'Olivarez,</hi> who was of no extraordinary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and the Faults of that <hi>Spaniard</hi> gave a great deal of Lustre to his Conduct.</p>
               <p>The Fleet of <hi>Spain,</hi> joyned to that of <hi>France,</hi> made up the number of an hundred Vessels, small and great; and this caused that the <hi>English</hi> durst not send a Convoy of Victuals, Wood and Coals, which was ready. The small quantity of Money which the King of <hi>England</hi> had, and his ill understanding with his Parliament, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned the delay of this Convoy. In the mean time the great <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Vessels anchored in the Road of the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and the little ones were employ'd to guard the Fence.</p>
               <p>This Work was not very much advanced, when the King, weary with being seven Months together at the Camp, and being called back to <hi>Paris</hi> by some important Affairs, he resolved to go thither, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Commission, which gave the Conduct of an Army to a Bishop, who understood nothing of War, and who every moment complained of want of Health, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the trouble of the Affairs of State, much surpriz'd those who knew not at all the necessity there was of the first Ministers being present at the Siege. The Cardinal, who was of as active and penetrating a Soul, as lofty and proud, was very capable of receiving the good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Generals, though he had little Experience in War; and he so strangely loved to command, that he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:187699:131"/> would do any Business besides his own without difficulty, provided he might have the Superintendency: Besides, it was important he should be at this Siege, that the Works might be pressed forward with all Expedition; whereas if he had been absent, either Money necessary had been wanting, or perhaps the unfaithfulness of some of the Commanders might have hindred the Enterprize: So that the choice which the King made of his Minister to command at the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> was founded on very good Reasons though it was thought unfit for a Bishop to be General of an Army. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery</hi>'s Life of the Card. Lib. 2. c. 17.</note> We are assured, that on the Day of the King's Departure, after he had receiv'd the Adieu's of all the World, he rode aside to a person of Quality who came to receive his Orders; and having leaned on him for a good while without speaking, at last said to him, <hi>My Heart is so heavy I am not able to speak, for the Grief oppresses me, that I must leave Monsieur the Cardinal, and the fear lest some evil accident should befal him. Tell him, in my behalf, that if he would have me believe he loves me, he must have a care of his Person, and not go incessantly, as he daily doth, into dangerous places: Let him consider in what Estate my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs would be should I lose him. I know how many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons busie themselves to hinder him from discharging himself of so weighty an Affair; but I so highly value this his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that I shall never forget it.</hi> In effect, the King had not strength enough of Spirit to govern alone, and he had already done so many Acts of Injustice in favour of the Cardinal, that the number of Malecontents was too great, and he could not live without him.</p>
               <p>The King being gone, no ceasing was made in all the Works, as much as the Season and the Sallies of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged would permit, and they at last so well finished the Lines of Circumvallation, that the Forts were all in a State of defence, and had mutual Communication: But the Fence or Dam advanced more slowly, because of the great Labour and bad Season, which often hindred their working.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal saw the Siege would take up a long time, and had reason to fear that the Army would be too much wasted by the carelessness and cheats of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ptains, and that the vast Charge would at last force
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:187699:131"/> them to give over the Enterprize, and the Soldiers, by being ill paid, and constrained to suffer too great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, would quite desert it, as hath happened in other Sieges. To remedy these inconveniences he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the Troops should be muster'd every eight Days, and gave a Commissary to every Regiment, who was to pay the Soldiers himself; who was also to take care that there were no Led-Horses. Thus the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knew every Week the number, and paid only those who were actually in the Camp: Whereas before there were a great number of Led-Horses, and more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were paid for than were effectively there. He also gave Cloaths to the Soldiers, that they might the better endure the Cold of the Winter and Spring, and so ordered, that Victuals always abounded in the Camp; and the Neighbouring Country people were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abused by the Soldiers.</p>
               <p>A little time after the King's departure, the Cardinal caused the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to be summoned to surrender, and regain his Majesty's Clemency; but they would not hear the Herald.

                     <hi>Aubery Bassomp.</hi> p. 470.</note> Enterprize on the Fort of <hi>Tadon</hi> two Days after, where <hi>Marillac</hi> commanded those who advanced first, to repair the Fault which he had made two Nights before. They caused a false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm to be given to the <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> of the Fort <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naille,</hi> and the Gate of the two Mills; and they sent a
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:187699:132"/> Man to those who were on the Guard at the Port of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to tell them, as if he had come from the Fort of <hi>Tadon,</hi> by order of him who commanded there, that they should not fire at all whatever noise they heard, because they had a Counter-design to execute against the Besiegers, who came to them along by the Sea side, and if they should shoot at the first noise, it might be at the people of the Fort. <hi>Marillac</hi> passing a little while after, those of the Port of <hi>St. Nicholas</hi> fir'd not, but they gave the Alarm in the City, that they might be ready on occasion. As soon as <hi>Marillac</hi> was near the Fort, the Sentinel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some to advance; and having discharged his Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, by the light thereof he saw the Troops which march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against him, he presently gave the Alarm, and <hi>Pontle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Saintonge,</hi> who commanded in the Fort, with five Companies of <hi>French</hi> and one of <hi>English,</hi> made his Men stand to their Arms, so that there was no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of forcing them. Thereupon <hi>Marillac,</hi> instead of saying, <hi>To the Right,</hi> cryed, <hi>Turn,</hi> to make his Men retreat, which caused a great confusion, and thirty or forty Men to be killed and wounded.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they begun to want many things in <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and were forced to open the Magazines of Corn and salt Meat to private Persons, and distribute those Provisions which were in no good condition, with extraordinary Ceremony. <hi>John Guiton,</hi> Mayor of the City, a Man of Experience and Conduct, took care to make them spare them as much as possible, until the Succours of the <hi>English</hi> which they impatiently waited for, should come. He also gave Orders for the defence of the City with great Prudence and Constancy. But he could not hinder many Soldiers, (who could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themselves to the Sobriety prescribed them) from going over to the Enemy, and carrying them News of the bad condition of the place. They received many of them at the beginning, but they refus'd those which continued to desert, for fear of easing the <hi>Rochellers</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Mouths. The Cardinal would not permit that the Mother of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> nor her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-Law should come out of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> for fear lest they should cabal for that Duke, who then made War in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and created a great deal of trouble to

               <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> had waited with impatience for the Tide of full Moon of the Equinoctial of <hi>March,</hi> which is commonly the greatest; but it had no great effect, overthrowing only some Fathoms at the end of the Fence, which were quickly repaired. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>In this Conjuncture the Cardinal thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the King should return to the Camp, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent when the <hi>English</hi> Succours appear'd, that the Soldiers might be the more encouraged.

He designed to cause some Men to enter that way; and having got the Cardinal to approve the Design, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal told the King of it, and all things were prepared to put it in execution. They made, I know not what kind of Machine, which they pretended to make use of on this occasion; but they were first to discover the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. They made it in an obscure Night, and having
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:187699:133"/> sounded the Place with a long Pole, they found it of so great depth, that the Design was judg'd impracticable by those who knew the Place; and for all Father <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Anger, who would have had them proceed, that Project vanish'd.</p>
               <p>A few days after <note n="*" place="margin">

That of <hi>France,</hi> which was made up of smaller Vessels, and Commanded by the Commander of <hi>Valença,</hi> ranged it self in the Channel between the two Points, and the Stoccado of sunk-Vessels was furnish'd with a Regiment on each side. They caused Thirty six Galleots to enter between the Fence and the City; and on each of them were put Twenty Men more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to oppose the Sallies of the <hi>Rochellers.</hi> As soon as they saw the <hi>English</hi> Fleet compos'd of Great Vessels, they judged its Enterprize would be vain, because there was not Water enough at the mouth of the Channel, to suffer Vessels of that bigness to come in.</p>
               <p>About seven of the Clock in the Evening, they drew near, to ride at the head of the Bay, where there was a Battery guarded by the Mareschal <hi>Bassompierre.</hi> To hinder their stopping there, the Mareschal made about fifty Cannon-shot at them, which made them take more room, and Anchor towards the <hi>Portuis</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>

There was but one of their Shallops, which being in the night mixed amongst those of the <hi>French,</hi> got into <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle.</hi> This retreat of the <hi>English,</hi> without attempting any thing, enraged extreamly the <hi>Rochellers</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> who Commanded them, although they promis'd suddenly to send them a more powerful Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:187699:133"/> The <hi>English</hi> might easily have foreseen, that they would have had occasion for light Vessels, and should at least have framed some Project before they departed; whereas from their arrival it appear'd, that they knew neither the state of the Fence, nor what they were to undertake. This was a Misfortune entail'd on the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I.

In the mean time, the Heat of the Summer had brought the Bloody Flux into the Army, with malignant Fevers, which oblig'd the Cardinal to change his Quarters, and much diminish'd the Courage of the Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The same day as the Cardinal wrote to those of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was kill'd at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> by a stab of a Knife from a <hi>Scots-man,</hi> nam'd <hi>Felton,</hi> just as he was going on board the Fleet, which was design'd for the Relief of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> This Man being taken, was so far from repenting of his Crime, that he said, That he had kill'd an Enemy to the State, and done great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his Country. That which occasion'd his talking thus, was, That the Parliament, who durst not accuse the King of a great many things which had been done, as they said, contrary to the Laws in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> had accused his Favourite, and would have him brought to Trial; which the King would not admit of.

               <p>The news of this Death being come to <hi>Rochelle,</hi> the Cardinal thought it a fit time to induce the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to surrender; and he caus'd <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery</hi>'s Life of the Cardinal, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> some Propositions to be made to them, by <hi>Arnaud,</hi> who went into <hi>Rochelle</hi> on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the exchange of his Brother-in-Law the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> who had for some Months been Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at War. A good part of those of the Government did not ill receive these Propositions; and Persons were deputed by the Cardinal, who having heard from his mouth what he proposed, were to report it to others. But they would not accept it, were it for fear he would be worse than his Word, or that the Demands which he made, were too disadvantageous; so that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to wait for the new <hi>English</hi> Succour.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, they were reduced to the utmost extremity, and a great number liv'd upon nothing but Cockles and Roots, which it was difficult to find. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. p. 442.</note> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Magistrates were resolv'd to capitulate; but that being, as it were, to submit to the Discretion of the Cardinal, who when he was once got into <hi>Rochelle,</hi> would have kept the Articles according to his Pleasure, the greatest part of the People, animated by the Mayor; opposed this Design. The contrary Party, to gain the People by Pity, took a Resolution to put all the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable mouths out of the Town; thinking that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, touch'd with so sad a Separation, would resolve to surrender. One night they caused to be assembled a great number of Women, Children, and old Men, and put them out of the Gates, without regard to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations. These miserable People in the morning went to the Besiegers Lines; but they drove them away with Musquet-shot, that they were forced to stay in some Meadows between the Lines and the City, where they lived on Herbs. The King and the Cardinal, far from pitying them, caused to fire upon them, to obliged the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:187699:134"/> Besieged to take them in again, as they did. They caused also all the Grass thereabouts to be cut down, that they might come and snatch it away in the night for their Nourishment.</p>
               <p>The King sent them word, That if they staid to the utmost extremity before they yielded, he would give them no quarter. They offer'd to do it, if they might conserve their Privileges; but it was pretended they were forfeited, and that they must entirely depend on the good Pleasure of the King.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. ib.</hi> p. 488.</note> nevertheless afterward consented to grant them their Goods and Lives, and some little Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges concerning the Magistrates; on condition, that after they had begg'd the King's Pardon, they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into the City, and pay four Musters which were due to the Army. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> proposed, on their side, that they would beg pardon with Ropes about their Necks, provided they might have their Privileges in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Religion and the Magistracy, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more about the demolition of <hi>Fort-Louis,</hi> or those in the Isles of <hi>Rhée</hi> and <hi>Oleron.</hi> They also demanded the King's Pardon for <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubise,</hi> as well as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and that Peace also should be made with <hi>England.</hi> The Cardinal replied, That the King would absolutely punish <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubise:</hi> That for the Cities of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> they should be treated with such Mildness as they deserv'd, without the <hi>Rochellers</hi> needing to concern themselves in the matter: That as to <hi>England,</hi> it was not for them to prescribe to the King what he had to do: And, That it was enough for them, that they were not punish'd according to their Deserts, for having drawn <hi>France</hi> into War on that side.</p>
               <p>The Deputies, to whom the Cardinal had made these Propositions, being entred into <hi>Rochelle,</hi> it was matter of surprize to find, that instead of an Answer, they heard the Guns of the Besieg'd to play as before. They also attempted to set fire on the Galleots which were between the Channel and the Fence; but not succeeding, they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:187699:135"/> sent a Drum to demand permission to send back their Deputies to the King; they were answer'd, That after their late Insolence, they should be receiv'd only at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. But after they had made them this Answer, it was resolv'd to renew the Treaty, in case they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new demanded leave to send their Deputies.</p>
               <p>In fine, the <hi>English</hi> Succours, Commanded by the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> appear'd in <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bassomp. Mem.</hi> T. 2. p. 500.</note> sight of the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> the 28th. of <hi>September,</hi> consisting of Seventy Vessels, which were follow'd by Thirty more the day ensuing. All the Army of <hi>France,</hi> which was Twenty thousand Foot, and Three thousand Horse, was many days in Arms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse the <hi>English,</hi> in case they should land to render themselves Masters of the Fence. It was then wholly finish'd, and there was only fifty geometrical Paces left open for the course of the Tide; and this Overture was so embarass'd with Vessels sunk full of Stones, that it was of difficult entrance. Nevertheless, it was believ'd, that if the <hi>English</hi> would have hazarded some Vessels, to knock with the Tide against the Fence, they might have overthrown a great part of it.</p>
               <p>The disposition of the <hi>French</hi> Army was the same as in the former Attack, the Fleet being at the mouth of the Channel, and the Land-Army rang'd on both sides the Gulf and the Fence: There were also two Batteries more; the one at the head of the Bay, of Forty Pieces of Cannon; the other at <hi>Coreille,</hi> of Twenty five. The <hi>English</hi> contented themselves the first five days to coast about the Sea-shoars, to look on the <hi>French</hi> Army, and to fire some Cannon without effect. They endeavour'd in vain to burn the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, by sending in some Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships with the Tide. But in the morning of the 3d. of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Fleet stood right into the Channel; and the Vanguard, in which was <hi>Soubise,</hi> and a great number of <hi>Rochellers,</hi> after they had made several Boards to gain the Wind, advanced towards the <hi>French</hi> Fleet within Cannon-shot: Every Ship discharged both Sides; after which, it retir'd. The main Battel and the Rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard did the same; and all the Fleet return'd three
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:187699:135"/> times to the Charge, in the same order, whilst the Tide lasted. The <hi>French</hi> answer'd them in the same manner with all their Artillery, as well from the Batteries as the Fleet. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> fired on their side, on the Galleots and on the Land-Forces; but it was so far off, that it did no execution.</p>
               <p>The Sea retiring about ten of the Clock, the <hi>English</hi> went back also, and did nothing all the day, but sending in (to no purpose) Fire-works and Fire-ships against the <hi>French</hi> Ships. The Artillery from the Land did them much damage, and they lost about Two hundred Men, and some Shallops, whereas the <hi>French</hi> lost not a Boat, and but Thirty seven Men. The <hi>English</hi> did the same thing on the morrow; nor was the issue more successful, they not daring to come to Boarding, for fear the <hi>French</hi> Army from Land should assist the Fleet on this occasion; nor durst they go to shake the Fence, where the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture presented it self. This was really a bold Attempt; but it was ridiculous to undertake to relieve a Place block'd up so near, and reduc'd to extremity, without being willing to hazard any thing. The <hi>English</hi> made a show, as if they would return with the Evening-Tide; but they advanc'd but half the way.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who were on board the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, desired to speak with the <hi>French</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: They permitted two to come on shoar in <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sompierre</hi>'s Quarter, who sent them to the Cardinal, of whom they desired permission to go into <hi>Rochelle,</hi> that they might return and tell the <hi>English</hi> the state of the Place. Having nothing more to say than this, The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal sent them back.</p>
               <p>After this, the Wind was so contrary to the <hi>English</hi> for some days, that they were oblig'd to remain at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery</hi>'s Life of the Cardinal. <hi>l</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note>. In the mean time, they thought to purpose to try if there were any way of Accommodation; and for this, the Lord <hi>Montague</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 7.</note> sent to Complement the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who found he sought an occasion to enter into a Conference; and therefore sent back four <hi>English</hi> Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:187699:136"/> without Ransom, and charged them to make his Compliments to <hi>Montague,</hi> and tell him, that he should have some good hopes of a Peace between the Two Crow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>The Prisoners being come to the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, and having spoken to <hi>Montague,</hi> he caus'd a Council to be assembled, whither <hi>Soubise</hi> and the <hi>Rochelle</hi> Deputies were call'd. <hi>Montague</hi> said what the Prisoners had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to him; and added, That he thought it would be advantageous to the Common Cause if he took this Opportunity which the Cardinal offer'd him for to know the Fence, under pretence of going to speak with him; and that taking an Enginier with him, he would not fail to bring back a certain account of it. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> who fear'd that <hi>Montague</hi> only sought means to treat without them, oppos'd this as much as they could: They represented, That as soon as the Fleet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that they would enter into a Negotiation, no body would fight: That as to what concern'd the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Fence by that means, the <hi>French</hi> Generals were too fine to let him know the weak Places: And, That <hi>Montague</hi> and his Enginier, after they had seen the strongest, would come and make a Relation conformable to the Designs of the Enemy, and proper to discourage every body. In the mean time, the <hi>English</hi> Officers, whose Intentions were not very good, although they feigned otherwise, caus'd it to be concluded in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to send a Shallop to the <hi>French</hi> Generals to demand exchange of Prisoners, and a safe Conduct for <hi>Montague</hi>

                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. according to <hi>Bassomp. Mem.</hi> T. 2. p. 500.</note>. Which accordingly was done: The Prisoners were sent back on each side, on the next day; and the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 14.</note>, <hi>Montague</hi> went to speak with the Cardinal; and returning, he said he had been very well receiv'd, and that the Cardinal had made him Propositions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general Repose of Christendom.</p>
               <p>He went <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 15.</note> the second time with his Enginier; and after he had din'd with the Cardinal, and conferr'd with him, they let him, the next day, in a Galleot, see the Fence, and all that they had put to embarass the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:187699:136"/> Those who sent him might assure themselves of one thing, That if one of the two were to be either cheated or impos'd upon by the other, it would not in the least be the Minister of the King of <hi>France.</hi> So that whether they expected this or not, they were not surprized to see <hi>Montague</hi> come back with his Engenier, and say, That it was impossible to break the Fence: That the Cardinal had made Propositions reasonable enough, touching a Peace with his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majesty, and with the <hi>Rochellers;</hi> and that it was necessary he should go to communicate these Propositions to the King; after which, he would return to the Fleet, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to do in fifteen days at the farthest. <hi>Charles,</hi> who assisted <hi>Rochelle</hi> only to avoid discontenting his People, (who earnestly desir'd it) was disposed to find all things reasonable.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery,</hi> ib.</note>, the Cardinal cunningly caused the <hi>French</hi> on board the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, and who began to be distrustful of the <hi>English,</hi> as well as the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> more press'd by Hunger than by force of Arms, to be advertis'd, That it would be a shame and disadvantage to them, if they should suffer an Agreement to be made for them by a foreign Prince, who consider'd not their Interest so much as his own: That they would make their Conditions much better, if they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Majesty's Clemency; because the King would be sooner inclin'd to favour them by their Submissions, than by the Instances of the King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and those who were on board the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Fleet, seeing, on the one side, the City reduc'd by Famine to a deplorable estate; and, on the other, the Coldness of the <hi>English</hi> in regard of them, apprehended it was at last time to accommodate themselves at any rate whatsoever <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. <hi>Bassomp.</hi> T. 2. p. 511.</note>. Those who were on the Fleet, sent a Drum to demand a safe Conduct for Deputies, which they desir'd to send to the Cardinal. They sent them on the next day, when the <hi>English Fleet</hi> came again to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade the <hi>French;</hi> that is, to make a great noise to no purpose: In the Evening the Deputies of the Fleet lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and were conducted to <hi>Saussaye,</hi> to speak with the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:187699:137"/> Cardinal; whilst six other Deputies appear'd near the Fort <hi>de la Fons,</hi> and demanded also to Parly. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal order'd they should be brought to him; and they came a little time after the others.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal caus'd them to be receiv'd in several Chambers; and the Mareschals <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> and <hi>Schomberg</hi> being with him, as well as <hi>Bouthillier,</hi> he commanded the Deputies of the Fleet to be brought in. They told him <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery,</hi> ib,</note>, That it was not without confusion that they appear'd before him, when they consider'd who they were from whom they came; yet nevertheless they had assum'd that Boldness, because that although they had been with Foreigners, yet their Consciences bore them witness, that their Hearts were <hi>French;</hi> which might appear, in that as soon as they had seen any Overture of an Accommodation, rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue shedding of Blood, they had sought all means to be admitted to his Greatness, and to offer to his Majesty to employ themselves to their Fellow-Citizens, to engage them to return to their Obedience: That they also sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated the Cardinal, to procure them the Favour of his Majesty; and to assure himself, that those who made this Prayer to him, would act with entire Sincerity in this Affair, and after such a manner as perhaps should not be unprofitable for the King's Service.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal answer'd them with sweetness enough; and told them, That he would not then consider their Faults, or those of their Fellow-Citizens: That they were indeed very great, but the Bounty of the King was greater to forget them: That he would make it his business to obtain his Majesty's Pardon, provided they would sincerely return to their Duty. He then ask'd them what assurance they had of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> which made them hope to reduce them. The Deputies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, That those of the City knew nothing of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; but if his Majesty would be pleas'd to permit them to speak with them, they had such forcible Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to represent to them, that they infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd themselves they would be of the same Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal desiring they would let him know some
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:187699:137"/> of those Reasons, the Deputies said, That in that case the best Fineness being to have none at all, they would discover them with Sincerity, to a Person whom they were not in a condition to deceive, and in and from whom were all their Hopes and Fears: That they confess'd they had done all they could, to obtain for the <hi>Rochellers</hi> strong and ready Succours; but they had experimented the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of solliciting Foreigners, who regard not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of those who beg their Protection, but only as it quadrates with their own: That they had given them a parcel of fine Words; but the effects which follow'd them, were in resemblance like to what such People would do, who desir'd <hi>Rochelle</hi> should be taken rather than reliev'd: That the <hi>English</hi> the Year fore-past had engag'd the <hi>Rochellers</hi> to their Party, a little before the Harvest, as if they would take from them the means to provide for themselves: That they had consum'd a great part of their Provisions whilst they were in the Isle of <hi>Rhée,</hi> which was another Expedient to reduce them to extremity: That having promis'd to send them Corn as soon as they return'd from <hi>England,</hi> and being urg'd to it without ceasing by the Deputies, they would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, though nothing was more easie: That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent Aids in <hi>May</hi> last, they came only to show them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and return without attempting any thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Rochellers</hi> which were with them had reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted some Vessels, with which they offer'd to enter at their own Peril: That the last Succours were come so late, that it was apparent they had a desire that the City should be taken before their arrival; or at least that it should be reduc'd to so great extremity, as to be oblig'd to make it self over clearly to them, that they might agree with <hi>France</hi> at their Expences: That, in fine, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> was gone into <hi>England,</hi> for no other Reasons but to obtain the Consent of the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to the Propositions had been made to him: That reflecting on all this, the Deputies were of Opinion, That since an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation was talk'd of, it would be more pleasing to the King, and more advantageous to their Fellow-Citizens, to receive Favour of his pure Clemency, than by the Intervention of a foreign Prince, who had been so ill a Guarrantee of the Treaty of the Year 1626. That
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:187699:138"/> they hoped to make their fellow-Citizens sensible of these Reasons, if the Cardinal would get them leave to go to them.</p>
               <p>That Prelate prais'd their good Intentions, and told them, that really they would obtain more from the King, by addressing themselves to him, than if a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince should concern himself. After that, he asked them, what security they could give that they would serve his Majesty according to their Promise? They answer'd, that they could give two: The first, the visible advantage of those for whom they treated; and the second, That one of them would stay in the Camp, to answer on peril of his Life, for the sincerity of his Companion. The Cardinal replied, That he hoped the King might trust them, and leave them both at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to execute their Design: And to give the better means to manage this Affair with Success, he said, That he would not hide from them, that the Brouilleries of <hi>Italy</hi> pressed so hard on his Majesty, that the days he employ'd before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> were as so many years; and that he would redeem every one of them, if it were possible, at a very large Summ; That those of <hi>Rochelle</hi> had given him to understand, that they could yet hold out three Months; That if it were so, he would give them a Chart-blank; but if it were not, it were not just that their obstinacy should obtain that, which they might have upon a free and voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; That his Majesty would therefore send Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners into the City, amongst whom the Deputies should be concerned, to take an account of the Victuals, and give a true report of their quantity; and if there were none, he expected the <hi>Rochellers</hi> should surrender at discretion.</p>
               <p>The Deputies beseeched the Cardinal not to make them Bearers of such sad Tidings, and to consider that it was impossible to take an exact Account of the Victuals in <hi>Rochelle;</hi> because private Persons who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would hide them with great care; That when they made a re-search in the Month of <hi>May</hi> last, they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:187699:138"/> found but one Months Provisions, yet six have since been elapsed: That besides, there must an account be taken of all the Fish, Cockles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Sea brings in, of all the Hides, of all the Leather, and all the Parchment, and generally of every thing which hath any Juice proper for Nourishment; That when all this would not suffice for the Subsistance of the Besieged for three Months, they might manage it so, that there should be enough and more for those who were capable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, and let the rest die with hunger: That he might well judge that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> would not be so stout if their Victuals were absolutely wanting, as had been told him, and that they attended to capitulate at the last Morsel; That they beseeched him to give them leave to carry the News of a Grace a little more extensive, that they might be in condition to make it valuable by their fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: and to think that they were to treat with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who would make it be seen, that when they could no longer live, they knew very well how to die. He who made this Speech, in finishing, shed some Tears, and those who heard appear'd affected.</p>
               <p>After this <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bassompierre</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, tells it thus, though <hi>Aubery</hi> tells it somewhat otherwise.</note> the Deputies of <hi>Rochelle</hi> were admitted, they entreated the Cardinal to obtain tolerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them from his Majesty, and promised they should be accepted: They also desir'd he would permit them to see their fellow-Citizens on board the <hi>English</hi> Fleet; after which they promis'd to put the City into the King's Hands. The Cardinal immediately answer'd them, That he would immediately let them see the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Fleet, if they would promise not to speak to them. When they had promis'd, he went himself to his Gallery, and told the Deputies of the Fleet, which were there, That he would let them see the Deputies of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> on condition they should say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them. They were infinitely surpriz'd on both sides, and saluted each other at a distance. They had both reason to fear, that the one side or other had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken things which did not agree, or might be hurtful to the common Interest; but they were not then permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to satisfie each other.</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:187699:139"/>
               <p> Those of the City again offer'd to put themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obedience of the King, and still supplicated the Cardinal, to procure his Majesty's Pardon. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd it them▪ and told them, that the King was gone abroad for eight Days, and that he would speak to him at his return. Upon this one of the Deputies cried out, <hi>How, my Lord, eight Days!</hi> Rochelle <hi>hath not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to live three.</hi> Then the Cardinal made a Discourse, in which he strongly set forth the evil consequences of their Obstinacy; after which he added, That he would induce the King to be merciful to them; and that very Hour he drew up Articles for them to carry back to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle.</hi> He offer'd them pardon for all was past, to grant them their Lives, liberty of their Religion, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Goods. As for their Privileges, and the Form of their Government, the King was to regulate at his Pleasure, and the Fortifications to be rased. The Deputies of the City said, That assuredly the Articles would be accepted, and took leave of the Cardinal, who also sent back those of the Fleet. They had moreover, before they parted, liberty to speak to each other, and those of the Fleet pray'd the others to comprehend them in their Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal, nevertheless, caus'd separate Grants of Pardon to be made for those of the City, and for those who had been abroad since the War. Those of the Fleet fearing they should be excluded by those of the City, who, at the extremity in which they were, would be constrain'd to any thing should be impos'd upon them, left themselves entirely to the Cardinal's Generosity, and brought him to intercede not only for those on board the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, but also for those whom this War had constrain'd to go out of the Kingdom. The Cardinal promis'd a Declaration should be granted them; by which the King should forget all past, and permit them to come into his Havens, even with the Prizes they had taken; intending they should enjoy the same Privileges with his other Subjects, and the free exercise of their Religion, putting them into the possession of all their
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:187699:139"/> Goods, excepting the Fruits which were consumed; and granting the space of three Months for those of <hi>Rhee</hi> and <hi>Rochelle</hi> to return into the Kingdom, and enjoy the same Privileges.</p>
               <p>The Minister, <hi>Vincent,</hi> who was one of the <hi>French</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties who were in the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, was to carry the King's Declaration to those who had sent him; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving assembled them all on board one of the <hi>Rochelle</hi> Ships which were in the Fleet, he read it to them▪ their Opinions were divided, and let <hi>Vincent</hi> say what he could, some would not confide in it. Besides, the <hi>English</hi> declar'd, That they would not let all the <hi>French</hi> Ships depart, having occasion, as they said, for some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes which they intended to make on the Coasts of <hi>Poitou</hi> and <hi>Saintonge,</hi> and particularly on <hi>Brouage.</hi> They were irritated against <hi>Vincent</hi> and the others, who had concluded with the Cardinal; not that they were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to see <hi>Rochelle</hi> fall into his Hands; but because they would apparently curry favour with him. <hi>Montague</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was return'd with all power to treat; but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal would not suffer a Foreign Power to meddle with the accommodating of the King's Subjects with their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and therefore had made Conditions equitable enough for the <hi>French</hi> who were amongst the <hi>English.</hi> By taking away the necessity they had been in of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Protection from Foreigners, he gave them leave to return into <hi>France,</hi> and thereby hindred the <hi>English</hi> from making use of them, that they might have Intelligencers in the Kingdom, and thereby cause new Brouilleries. As to the Peace with <hi>England,</hi> having seen the ill Conduct of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and farther knowing, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the first was but little belov'd of his Subjects, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the King of <hi>England</hi> should first request it of the most Christian King: And after the Reducement of <hi>Rochelle</hi> he spoke of the <hi>English</hi> with much more disdain.</p>

                     <hi>Aubery</hi>'s Life of Card. Lib. 2. c. 21.</note> was to cause a great quantity of Meat and Ammunition-Bread to be brought into the Town, and to publish by beat of Drum, That whosoever had occasion might send for it. The day following it was necessary to bring a number of Men
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:187699:144"/> into the City out of the Camp to bury the dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses, which remain'd in great numbers without burial, in private Houses and other Places; whole Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead of Hunger, and the other seeing themselves at a Wake of the same nature, no Person took care to bury the dead; and the Houses being shut, serv'd for Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres to those who had inhabited them.</p>
               <p>After they had clean'd the Houses and the Streets, on the 1st. of <hi>November</hi> the Cardinal said Mass in St. <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>'s Church, which had been new Dedicated by the Archbishop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and he there gave the Sacrament to the Keeper of the Seals, and the Mareschal of <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg:</hi> After which, he went out of the City to accompany the King at his Entry. He march'd singly on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and was preceeded by the Duke of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> who had the Mareschals of <hi>Bassompierre</hi> and <hi>Schomberg</hi> on his sides.</p>
               <p>Thus it was that the Cardinal subdu'd <hi>Rochelle</hi> to the Despotick Power of the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> a Design in which he spent vast Summs, and sacrific'd the Lives of above Forty thousand of the King's Subjects, as well of one as the other Religion. All this might have been avoided, by the Observation of the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and employing the Treasure to make the Crown flourish, and repulse the Enemies of the State; and to make the Subjects of the Crown happy, in sparing their Money which was consum'd, and their Blood which was spilt, to make the King absolute over one City. One might have seen, by the Constancy and Bravery of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> in suffering, during a Siege of more than a Year, which reduc'd them to the last extremity, what they could have done for the King, if he would have allow'd some Privileges which cost him nothing, and treated them as his Catholick Subjects, if he had pleas'd to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them against the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It cannot be said, that it needed to be fear'd that they would rise at the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some Disturbers; because it is most certain, that let the great Ones do what they will, whilst the People find themselves but indifferently well, and are convinc'd
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:187699:144"/> that those who govern them, do not seek to spoil them of their Privileges, and the Fruits of their Industry, they will never suffer themselves to be seduc'd, and always preferr the certain Enjoyment of what they have, to the uncertain Hopes of what may be given them. There is not one Example, that Subjects of a Monarchy, quietly enjoying Liberty of Conscience, and their Goods, and having no reason to suspect the taking them from them, have taken Arms against their Prince. But when those whose Revenues and Authority are founded on some Opinions of the People, which have no relation to the Good of the State, do intermeddle in the Administration of Affairs, or engage Princes to follow their Opinions, we never fail to see all things sacrific'd to the Interest and Passion of those, who ought to think of nothing more than to give Examples contrary to this fatal Conduct, which hath overthrown so many States, and shed so much Blood. Besides, those who look on the People as a kind of Slaves, who ought to suffer all things from their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, count for nothing all the Breaches which are made on the best establish'd Privileges, and the most equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Laws: The greatest Violence of the Ministers, in their Opinion, are no way contrary to the good of the Publick; but if the People bethink themselves to show some Resentment, it is a Crime can no way be expiated; and there is not any danger to which the Estate is not to be expos'd, not only to punish, but also to hinder the People from falling into it again.</p>
               <p>These are the Maxims of which the Cardinal was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd; and they even said, That whilst he labour'd to ruine the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who at the bottom only sought not to be Slaves to the Capricio's of the Court, but to be govern'd according to the Laws, he forgot not to make himself Creatures who depended solely on him <note n="*" place="margin">

He would, as was said, have his Officers look upon him as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; and that in all Changes of the Court, they should always be for him, towards all, and against all, without
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:187699:145"/> exception. These are the Conditions, as was said, which he made with all he entertain'd; and he dismiss'd from the King's Service those whom he judg'd to be his most faithful Servants, to bring them into his own: That if any one remain'd inviolably fix'd to the sole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King, it was an assured Rule to be in the evil Opinion of the Minister, and never to come to Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:187699:145"/> Walls, the Ramparts, the Bastions, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortifications, except the Towns of St. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> of the Chain, and of the Lanthorn; and the Walls on the Sea-side, which were necessary to secure the Inhabitants against the Incursions of Pirates, should be rased, their Foundations demolish'd, and their Ditches fill'd up; so that the City should be open on all sides, without ever being re-establish'd for the future; nor any Wall to be thereafter made, no not for the inclosure of a Garden: That the City should be for the future liable to Taxes; and nevertheless for encouragement of Trade, the Imposition should be moderated to the Summ of Four thousand Livres, which should be instead of the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd formerly for the Subvention: That no Stranger, or Foreigner, should again inhabit there, altho he had obtain'd Letters of Naturalization: That the same Prohibition should be of force, in regard of those who made profession of the pretended Reformed Religion, or any other than the Catholick Religion; none of which were to become new Inhabitants, at least if they had not dwelt there as House-keepers before, or were not gone or departed on occasion of the <hi>English</hi> Descent: That, in fine, for the maintenance of this New Polity, which equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Religion and State, there shall be an Intendant of Justice in this City, and in the Provinces of <hi>Aunis,</hi> of <hi>Poitou</hi> and of <hi>Saintonge,</hi> and whose Jurisdiction should extend from the River <hi>Loire,</hi> to the Rivers of <hi>Garonne</hi> and <hi>Gironde.</hi>

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:187699:146"/> defended it against the <hi>English</hi> Army, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was well beloved of the King.

               <head>THE HISTORY Of the Famous Cardinal <hi>de RICHLIEƲ.</hi> VOL. I. BOOK III.</head>
               <head type="sub">Containing the Principal Occurrences at Home and Abroad under the Cardinal's Ministry, from the Siege of <hi>Rochel</hi> in 1628, and the Reduction of that Place, to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Departure out of <hi>France</hi> in 1631.</head>
               <p>THE Siege of <hi>Rochel</hi> was too Remarkable to be passed slightly over, or receive any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption in the Narration: For which reason I remitted to the beginning of this Book, a Relation of the principal Things which passed in <hi>France,</hi> during the last Ten Months of that Siege, and which are too important to the Sequel of this History, to be delivered in a few words, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the end of the preceding Book, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too long.</p>

                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:187699:147"/> if he would Marry his Daughter, Eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns for her Portion. He also ordered his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville,</hi> to offer to the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Coigneux,</hi> the Priory of <hi>la Charité,</hi> which had Eight thousand Crowns Revenue belonging to it, and to <hi>Puy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurens,</hi> the Government of the Dutchy of <hi>Nevers,</hi> if they could induce Monsieur to Marry that Princess. In the mean time the Queen-Mother opposed it all along with the same heat, and left nothing unessayed which might engage her Son to the Princess <hi>Anne de Medicis:</hi> But when she discoursed him about it, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri ibid.</hi> P. 328.</note> he told her she was too young, and that his Circumstances required a Wife, by whom he might have Children presently; and besides that the Portion, the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> would give her was inconsiderable. The Queen in vain remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to him, that the Promises of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> were meer <hi>Chimera's,</hi> and that he could not bestow so much on his Daughter, without ruining his Family. <hi>Gaston</hi> obstinately persisted to refuse <hi>Anne,</hi> and the Reasons he gave for it were as strong, at least, as those which they brought against <hi>Mary de Gonzaga.</hi> So the Queen-Mother found there was no other way to break her Son's Design, but to spin out the Business as long as she could, in hopes some Change might happen to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barràss that Affair. In the interim she forbid Monsieur to see the Princess of <hi>Mantua</hi> at her House, and the Princess to come to the <hi>Louure,</hi> for fear the Prince should so far settle his Affections, as that it would be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to remove them. The King also wrote to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that if he continued his Thoughts of Marrying his Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> he would contribute nothing towards the Support of him in his Dominions. He declared at the same time to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur, that he would never consent to that Marriage, and <hi>Gaston</hi> was forced to pass his word, that he would not Espouse the Princess of <hi>Mantua,</hi> without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their Majesties.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, as it was impossible to hinder Monsieur on several Occasions to see that Princess, whom her Aunt the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville</hi> carried about with her every where, where she imagined the Prince might
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:187699:147"/> come; and as these Interviews confirmed him in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Marrying her; the Queen-Mother, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bascomp. Mem.</hi> T. 2. P. 49.</note> to break off this Correspondence, wrote to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to send for his Daughter home. That Prince stood in so much need of the Assistance of <hi>France,</hi> to confirm him in the Possession of the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself obliged to give the Queen-Mother that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, whatever advantage he might hope for the future by that Alliance. He sent Word to the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville,</hi> to hasten his Daughter's departure out of <hi>Paris;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">20 <hi>April, Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. P. 398.</note> so the Dutchess brought her to <hi>Colmiers,</hi> to conduct her to the <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Avenay</hi> in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> where her Sister was Abbess, and in which place she was until he could send for her into <hi>Italy.</hi> About two Months after he gave Orders for her speedy passing the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which was taken well both by the King and Queen-Mother. But Monsieur made such a noise upon this Affair, and was so urgent with the King, to put a stop to her journey, that the King granted his Request. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bassomp.</hi> T. 2. P. 492.</note> Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> without whose Advice the King would not meddle with an Affair of this Consequence, was of Opinion, that Satisfaction was to be given to Monsieur, were it, that he designed to regain the Amity of that Prince, or to traverse the Queen-Mother's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of perpetuating her Authority in the Government. This Princess was in great perplexity, and began to suspect the Cardinal had more regard to his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest than those of his Benefactress. She suspected also that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> would not have sent for his Daughter, but with design to have her stopped, and secretly kept Intelligence with those Persons that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged her Match with <hi>Gaston:</hi> This caused a great Coldness in her, as to what concerned the Affairs of <hi>Mantua.</hi> But the Interest of State obliged them to assist him; so that it seems little care was taken to comply with the Queen-Mother's Desires.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal at his Return to <hi>Paris,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Rochel,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. P. 507.</note> received a visit from the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who earnestly pressed him to obtain Their Majesties leave for him to marry <hi>Mary de Gonzaga,</hi> and told him, he would look upon it as a particular Obligation. The
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:187699:148"/> Cardinal made Answer, <hi>That as Monsieur was the Second Person of the Kingdom, he had always professed Obedience to him; but on this occasion, all he could do was to stand Neuter, without opposing or favouring his Desires. The Reason was, because the King had positively forbid him to speak of that Marriage, and he durst not disobey him. That the Queen-Mother having conceived an Aversion to this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, which she judged could not be advantageous to the Crown, by Reason the Princess of</hi> Mantua <hi>was sickly: He durst not oppose himself to Her Majesty's Will, to whom he was so infinitely obliged. That Monsieur ought to endeavour himself to render the King and Queen-Mother flexible, whilst the Cardinal would pray to God to inspire them for the best.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported, that <hi>Fabbroni</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 496.</note> assured the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the King was near the Point of Death, and that Monsieur would ascend the Throne, which kept this Princess in a perpetual inquietude, because she feared, that if Monsieur was once Master of his own Actions, he would immediately marry the Princess of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who would never pardon the many cross Designs she had set on foot to hinder her Marriage. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 508.</note> It is also said, that the Cardinal was troubled with the same weakness as the Queen-Mother, concerning judicial Astrology, and that having consulted <hi>Peter Campanella,</hi> about what should befal the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> this Monk answered, <hi>Imperium non gustabit in aeternum: He shall never come to Rule:</hi> Which quieted his Mind as to that Affair. Thus the Astrologers predicting opposite things, it must of necessity so happen, that one must be in the Right, which gives occasion to those who believe their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures to defend them, saying, That those, whose Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were false, either knew not the Rules of the Art or did not apply them as they should. By this Method, it is impossible to disabuse them, because they take no notice of false Predictions, and only put a value on those which are confirmed by the Event, as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Proofs of the certainty of Astrology. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinal was really bewitched by this cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Art, or no; 'tis certain, that the King had none of the best Constitutions, that he had no Children, and so
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:187699:148"/> might reasonably enough fear the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> would succeed to the Throne. He had never shew'd himself very Complaisant to him before, and at the beginning of the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> sent him back to <hi>Paris,</hi> though he had been declared Lieutenant-General of the Army which besieged that City.</p>
               <p>During the Siege of this Place, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See the Sequel of the Rebellion of</hi> France <hi>on this Year.</hi>
                  </note> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> acted in <hi>Languedoc</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> with two Armies, each of which were stronger than his; the two Royal Armies consisting of Ten Thousand Men each, and that of the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> had not above Six Thousand. I will not lose time in relating the several Circumstances of this War, since all this Year the Cardinal had no part in it; 'tis suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to observe, that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who had neither of them any great Reason to love the Cardinal, because he never treated them, as Persons of their Birth and Rank might justly expect, strove to rob him of his Glory, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his Authority, which in the end proved fatal to one of them, and on which the other depended all his Life time. By ruining the Forces of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> by taking their Places, and destroying their Lands, and crossing the Designs of that Party as much as possibly they could, they hastned the taking of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> in which the Cardinal was so highly interested, that he would have lost all his Reputation, had he not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>The Expence which was to be made for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of so many Armies, obliged the King to demand of the Clergy the Sum of Three Millions of Livres, <note n="*" place="margin">17 June <hi>Sequel of the Rebell.</hi> 752.</note> which was granted him; as also to create many new Offices, to make a Constitution of Three Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Livres of Rent on the <hi>Hotel</hi> of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to have recourse to many other extraordinary Ways, to find ready Money.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. P. 312, &amp;c.</note> before he parted for <hi>Mantua</hi> had obtained a promise of Succours from the Court, to aid him, as much as possibly they could, in the perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity and Charges in which he was ingaged. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had reiterated this Promise after his Departure,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:187699:149"/> to <hi>Friandi</hi> his Agent in <hi>France.</hi> But as <hi>Spain</hi> supported the Prince of <hi>Guastalla,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions on <hi>Montferrat,</hi> it was conceived necessary that the new Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> should use his utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to accommodate himself with them, because the Court was not then in Condition to give him any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Assistance. They thought it likewise expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to endeavour to appease the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was incensed to the highest degree, at the Duke of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi>'s Marriage with his Daughter, without ever asking his Consent, or that of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Mother to the Princess. They dispatched an Express to him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> to divert the Storm which threatned the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that he might be put into Possession of his Estates with the Consent of those Powers. The Ambassadors of the Crown, amongst the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> had Orders to use their Endeavours to induce them to be favourable to him.</p>
               <p>But the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> being unwilling to stay the end of the Negotiation, which was now going to be set on foot, to satisfie him as to his Pretensions on <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:187699:149"/> repair into <hi>Italy,</hi> to put it in Execution. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> likewise and <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> had other Designs in their Head, than to stay for the Emperor's Commissioner. They had already divided <hi>Montferrat.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> was to have <hi>Casal, Nice, Montcalvo, Aiqui, Ponzone,</hi> and some other Places; and the Duke of <hi>Alva, Tririo, St. Damien,</hi> and some other Territories lying within <hi>Piemont.</hi> Each was to take what he pretended to keep; and it was agreed, that no new Fortifications should be made. <hi>D. Gonzales,</hi> the better to compass his Design, had given a small Body of Men to the Marquis of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereno,</hi> to cover the Territory of <hi>Cremona,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> prepared to make some Incursions, with his Troops and those Succours he expected from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whom the Motions of <hi>D. Gonzale</hi> had allarm'd. He was also to leave another small Army near the Lake of <hi>Como,</hi> to stop up the Passes of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline,</hi> by which Soldiers might come to the Service of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> So that he could not bring before <hi>Casal</hi> above Two thousand Horse, and Eight thousand Foot. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> April.</note> He invested it so negligently, that abundance of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and <hi>French</hi> Souldiers threw themselves into the Place, with all sorts of Ammunition, without which it had been impossible it should have made any long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> kept Correspondence in this Place with one <hi>Spadino,</hi> upon whom he relied more than on the Force of Arms. He had placed so much Confidence in this Man, that he assured the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> that he was certain to become Master of <hi>Casal</hi> as soon as he appeared before it. Upon this assurance, the Courrier, which should have gone to bring him Letters, to live peaceably with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> was stopped, and others were written to the contrary. But the Design of <hi>Spadino</hi> being discovered, and he put to Death, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of <hi>Casal</hi> made so vigorous a Resistence, and were so faintly attacked, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to repent themselves of their unjust Enterprize.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who at the same time had taken the Campagne, made himself Master of <hi>Alba</hi> and of <hi>Trino</hi> with no great difficulty, those Places being found unprovided of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>hings. <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> had intreated
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:187699:150"/> him, whilst he was before the last of these two Places, to come and join him, to prosecute the Siege of <hi>Casal,</hi> but <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> chose rather to take what was to remain in his Hands, than to lose his time by putting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Possession of such Places as were to fall to there share. He presently Fortified <hi>Trino,</hi> to render it capable of enduring a Siege; which was contrary to the Treaty he had made with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> which raised a great deal of Jealousie in them; so that they could not behold without regret, so strong a Place in the Hands of so stirring a Prince, as <hi>Charles Emanuel.</hi> They feared, that he secretly hindred their Design of taking <hi>Casal,</hi> a Place of such Consequence in respect of <hi>Piemont.</hi> That those who had <hi>Casal</hi> might disturbe it at their Pleasure. In the mean time they durst not discover their disgust to the Duke, lest they should cause a Rupture with that Prince, at a time when they stood in need of him.</p>
               <p>A little after the Duke took <hi>Pontesture,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Part, was instantly put into their Hands, but he did not so with <hi>Moncalvo,</hi> into which he put a <hi>Piemontese</hi> Garrison, because of the Importance of the Place, thô by the Treaty it should have belonged to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> These Proceedings increased the Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions they had entertained against the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by means of this Conduct, who demonstrated a desire of aggrandising himself by any ways whatsover, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling himself about Promises or Treaties. The Count of <hi>Serbelle</hi> also made himself Master of <hi>Nice de la Paille,</hi> notwithstanding the brave Resistance of the Besieged, who sold it him dear enough.</p>
               <p>These Progresses put the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> into extream Confusions, who was lamented of by all the World, but helped by none, who found himself destitute of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, not daring to trust the Nobility of his States, thô the most were very affectionate to his Service. The King of <hi>France</hi> was so busied before <hi>Rochel,</hi> that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void drawing the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> on his Back, he durst do nothing in Favour of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:187699:150"/> believed he designed to Marry his Daughter to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur, hindred an open Declaration in his Behalf, or furnishing him with Forces sufficient for his Relief. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were willing to succor him with all their Forces, but they were fearful to engage singly in this Affair, and without the Forces of <hi>France,</hi> they believed themselves not able to oppose the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> The other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> contented themselves with disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Violence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> without effectually Succouring the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who was oppressed by these Two puissant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>The Emperor knowing that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had made use of his Name in the Invasion they had made on <hi>Montferrat,</hi> as if they had acted only by his Orders, shewed a great deal of Resentment, and publickly declared, that he had given them none. The Count of <hi>Nassau</hi> shortly <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The 30th of</hi> April.</note> arrived at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and required the Duke in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Name to put his strongest Places into his Hands, that he might put <hi>German</hi> Garrisons in them, until His Majesty had determined to whom the Succession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. The Duke took some time to consider of it, and in the interim sent Expresses to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> to know what Answer he should make to the Emperor. The <hi>Venetians</hi> being in as great trouble as himself, and fearing to advise him, to the Execution of that, to which they must be obliged to contribute, only answered, that the knowledge which he had of the Emperor's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of the Assistance of <hi>France,</hi> ought to serve as a Rule for his Conduct. All that <hi>France</hi> did, was to give Order to Monsieur <hi>de Crequi,</hi> to raise Eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot and Eight hundred Horse, and to pass them with all speed into <hi>Montferrat.</hi> She granted besides to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that Army, and he engaged himself to bring them into <hi>Montferrat</hi> in spite of all the Oppositions of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> They made besides many other Levies, with a design to join with those of the Mareschal to go to <hi>Casal</hi> as soon as possible, and endeavour to raise the Siege. Although the Queen-Mother favoured not the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:187699:151"/> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and that besides the Siege of <hi>Rochel</hi> caused the Succours promised him to be delayed, yet the Cardinal continued in the Opinion that he ought to be assisted, and that as soon as possible. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wrote to his Ambassador at <hi>Rome,</hi> to impart to his Holiness, that as soon as <hi>Rochel</hi> had submitted, he would take a Journey into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> to be nearer at hand to Succour the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The Nuntio <hi>Bagni</hi> who had succeeded Cardinal <hi>Spada,</hi> and <hi>Zorzi</hi> Ambassador of <hi>Venice,</hi> did strongly urge the King to send a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army, without which neither the Pope nor the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> would hazard themselves by declaring for the Duke.</p>

               <p>The Cardinal, in concurrence with the rest of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, could not suffer that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should oppress the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> (whose Rights were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable) only because he was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> but it was impossible to succour him with that speed as was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, to draw him out of his present Danger, because of the difficulty of the Passage of those Troops, which must be sent him at a time when all were busied in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:187699:151"/> other Affairs. To gain time he caused divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to be made at <hi>Madrid</hi> and at <hi>Turin,</hi> and fell upon several Projects, which were all disapproved.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> found himself in a great Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as having neither Money nor Troops to resist any longer. When Orders were given to the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> to force the passage of the <hi>Alps,</hi> if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> refused to grant it willingly. The Duke having notice of this, put himself in a Posture to oppose the Mareschal, and <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> sent him part of his Troops, to take away from <hi>Crequi</hi> all hopes of making his way. But as every Body expected to see the latter set forward with the Troops of the King, and those which the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> had raised in <hi>France,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles,</hi> he <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In the Month of</hi> July.</note> on a sudden ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused himself that he could not do it. Some attributed this Change to his not being declared General of that Army, and others to a secret Order, founded on this Maxime, That nothing was to be undertaken during the Siege of <hi>Rochel.</hi> In the mean time this Conduct strangely discredited the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they were suddenly expected; and the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> pressed most earnestly the vigorous Succour of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but though they were engaged to support him, yet would they assist only with a little Money and Corn, which they permitted him to have out of their Territories. Whatever Instances were made to engage the Mareschal <hi>Crequi</hi> to assist the Army Commanded by <hi>Ʋxelles</hi> to pass the Mountains, yet would he do nothing nor stir a Foot from <hi>Grenoble.</hi> Instead of furnishing this Army with Victuals, he forbid through all his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Dauphine</hi> any to be sold them, so that a great Part were forced to Desert. However the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>d'Ʋxelles</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In the Month of</hi> August.</note> resolved to attempt the Passage, with the remainder of his Soldiers, which amounted to Ten Thousand Foot, and a Thousand Eight Hundred Horse. He advanced with a great deal of difficulty to Fort St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Marquisate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> where he found the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Army Entrenched. After some Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, the <hi>French</hi> found that this Passage was too strongly Fortified, to undertake to force it, against an
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:187699:152"/> Army which at last by the accession of the Troops, which arrived continually to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was by far stronger than theirs. Upon this the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles</hi> concluded on a retreat, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would not follow him into the <hi>French</hi> Territories out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the King; otherwise he might have cut them to pieces. So he contented himself with some Baggage and Ammunition which the <hi>French</hi> could not carry with them. In the mean time a Suspension of Arms was made, by the intervention of the Nuntio <hi>Scappi,</hi> but it turned to no account.</p>
               <p>This Army which was thought capable to raise the Siege of <hi>Casal,</hi> dispersed it self entirely at its arrival into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> by the Malice of the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> who was accused to have leaned too much to the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Queen-Mother, who was provoked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reason against the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> on the Account of his Daughter. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 6. P. 456.</note> The Cardinal was exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, when he received the News of the ill Success of the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles</hi> Enterprise. He complained in severe Terms to the Marquis <hi>de Canaples,</hi> Son to the Mareschal. He also charged <hi>Priandi</hi> to write to his Master, that the Forces which the King had caused to be raised were still on foot, that if the Duke levied Eight Thousand Men of those which dispersed on the Frontiers, there would be enough to support him for the present, and that better Orders should be given for their Subsistance than had hitherto been done.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Imperial Decree appeared dated the 17th of <hi>August,</hi> by which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> commanded the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to obey in Thirty Days, or else to be proceeded against with Rigour. Some of the Ministers of <hi>France</hi> were of Opinion, that the should offer to deposit <hi>Casal</hi> and <hi>Montferrat</hi> into the Hands of the Pope, or of the Grand Duke, which of them should be named by the Emperor, on Condition that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> would first restore what they had taken into the Hands of a Depositary; because if they refused to do it, as in all appearance they would, the non-Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Imperial Decree, would be long of them and not of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who by consequence
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:187699:152"/> could not be put under the Ban of the Empire. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they did not intend to make their Concessions, but in Case <hi>Casal</hi> could not hold out all the Month of <hi>November,</hi> but if that Place could be kept longer, the Cardinal especially was of Opinion, that the Duke should keep all in his own Hands, since the King would have time enough to relieve him. Supposing the worst, it was not possible to execute the Emperor's Order so readily, as the Decree specified, but in the mean time it was judged requisite, that the Duke should remain in Arms. In fine, he answered, That he was ready to remit to the Duke of <hi>Guastalla</hi> what he demanded, <hi>viz. Reggivolo,</hi> and the Vallies contiguous in <hi>Fief,</hi> on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would submit to the Judgment of the Pope, or the Grand Duke concerning the Rights which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have on the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that so all sorts of Disputes might be prevented. As to what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he consented to deposite it in the Hands of his Impetial Majesty, if he would name for Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary either the Prince of <hi>Mantua</hi> his Son, or the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess his Daughter-in-Law, or either of them, and that for Three Months, in which time Judgment might be made of the Rights of those who were Pretenders.</p>
               <p>The Emperor rejected those Propositions, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> having declared the Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Arms to be ended, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>See them in Siri</hi> T. 6. P. 484.</note> there came new Articles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> by which the Emperor acted more like an Arbitrary Person than a Judge, proposing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> should in his Name keep what they had taken in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Duke the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to the end of the Process: And that <hi>Casal</hi> should be kept by a Garrison of the Emperor's drawn out of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Troops that were in <hi>Italy.</hi> But it was unjust to dispossess the legitimate Successor of the Estates of the House of <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> and to leave to Usurpers what by force of Arms only they had taken Possession of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:187699:153"/> Besides, there we no <hi>Germans</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> but one Regiment which was in the Service of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and which depended more on them than on the Emperor. To endeavour better Conditions at the Imperial to obtain Court, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> upon the Parole of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, sent his Eldest Son to <hi>Vienna.</hi> The delay of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors which were promised on the Behalf of <hi>France,</hi> and which in appearance could not now pass the Mountains by reason of the Snow, engaged the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to seek at any rate some means to appease the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p>But no sooner was <hi>Rochel</hi> taken, but the Cardinal thought of nothing more than how to humble the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and to succour the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> without Delays, This Affair nevertheless being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in a Council, whither were called the Principal Lords of the Realm, all were of the same Opinion. * The Cardinal <hi>de Berulle,</hi> who was the Chief of the <note place="margin">Aub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This Advice was taken, and Twelve Thousand Foot and Fifteen or Sixteen Hundred Horse under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Thoiras,</hi> were ordered to march <note n="*" place="margin">

In the mean time all endeavours were used, to bring off the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> from the Interest of <hi>Spain,</hi> as well by Promises as by Threats. But that Prince remained unalterable, because he perceived very well, that <hi>France</hi> so far concerned it self in the Interests of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as not to suffer any considerable Part of his Estates to be taken from him.</p>

               <p>In the interim many Expresses come from the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to give Intelligence of the great Extremity <hi>Casal</hi> was reduced to, and to communicate a Project for a Treaty, which he believed he might make with the Emperor.

The Duke pretended, that that need not be any hindrance to the continuance of the Treaty, but the Count would give no ear to it.</p>
               <p>After this, there seemed nothing further to be done by the Imperial Commissary, but to put the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> under the Ban of the Empire.

The King replied, he would do it; and from that time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself for it, though he departed not so soon as the Cardinal had advised.

The Parliament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Custom, applauded the King's Design; and confirmed several Declarations, proper to bring Money into the King's Coffers, which were totally exhausted by the Expences of the precedent Year. The King published an <hi>Amnesty</hi> through all the Huguenot Cities, and to all of that Party, who should within Fifteen Days after Publication accept of the Pardon which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, not excluding <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Soubize.</hi> It was believed that the Huguenots, who plainly might

P. 603.</note> they departed in a very bad Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to come to the Foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> which was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Snow: As soon as they arrived there with the Army, whose March was exceeding painful, they sent the Commander <hi>de Valenças</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to demand Passage and Victuals for the Army, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of about Twenty-four Thousand Foot, and Two Thousand five hundred Horse. The King would have Security for the Passage and Victuals for ready Money, in recompence whereof he offered to give <hi>Trino</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> with Lands in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which should yield him Twelve Thousand Gold Crowns in annual Rent, provided he would renounce all Pretensions he might have on the Dutchy. <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself disposed to satisfie the King, but sought by all ways he could to delay the Execution of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and in the mean time fortified the Passages as much as possibly he could. He also made divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to the King by the Count de <hi>Verrile,</hi> which did not at all relate to the Business in hand, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Count declared he had no Power to conclude any thing.</p>
               <p>In the interim, as the Design of the Duke was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceived, to be for nothing but to gain time, to Fortifie the Passes, or to make <hi>Casal</hi> fall into the Hands
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:187699:156"/> of the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> the Army daily advanced. Being come to <hi>Chaumont,</hi> which is not far from <hi>Susa;</hi> the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> came thither <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The 4th</hi> March.</note> to conferr with the Cardinal. That Prelate pressed him, to grant the King his Desires, rather than oblige him to force his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and the Prince seemed to be confounded with his Reasons, but could make no Conclusion, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Duke his Father. He went to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him what had passed between him and the Cardinal, and return with Orders from the Duke, but instead of bringing them himself, he sent the Count <hi>de Verrue</hi> on the morrow, who said, that the Prince not finding his Father at <hi>Rivoli,</hi> as he supposed was gone to <hi>Turin</hi> to speak with him, and therefore they must expect no News from him that Day. He added, That the Duke his Master, though indisposed, was resolved to wait in Person on the King, and would be brought in a Chair, rather than make any further delay. The Cardinal was too cunning not to discover so palpable a Subterfuge, and therefore pressed so hard upon the Count, to draw out of him the Duke's Intentions, that at last he declared, that if the King would suffer his Highness to keep what he had taken in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had done, the Passes should be instantly open to the Royal Army. The Cardinal rejected this Proposition, and said; <hi>That knowing the King's Justice and Generosity, he was assured his Majesty would reject it. And that there was a vast difference between what the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>had received from the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>in favour of a manifest Ʋsurpation, and what he might hope for from the King, who was come to relieve a Prince who was his Allie, and not to ruine him: But he would not delay to acquaint his Majesty with what he had proposed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal then received various Intelligences, which gave him to understand, that the Troops of <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zales</hi> were advancing as fast as he could be, and that some of them were already entred into <hi>Susa.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to fear, that if longer time were given to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> it would be a difficult Task to force the Passage. After he had held a Council of War with the three Mareschals of <hi>France</hi> who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:187699:156"/> he was resolved on the morrow the 6th of <hi>March,</hi> to attack the Barricadoes which the Duke had made on the way to <hi>Susa,</hi> in the narrowest Place between two Mountains. They first got Cognizance of them by a Man whom they sent to <hi>Susa,</hi> on Pretence of a Letter to the Count <hi>de Verrue,</hi> or in his Absence to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Place. This Man acquainted them with what he had seen, and thereupon they formed the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. The Cardinal wrote to the King the Evening before, and the King marched all Night in bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come to <hi>Chaumont,</hi> whither he arrived very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Morning.</p>
               <p>About Seven of the Clock the King and the Cardinal appeared in the Field of Battle, and attacked the Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadoes in the Front, whilst the other Troops passed on the Tops of the Mountains to the Right and Left. These last no sooner appeared on the Flanks of the <hi>Piedmonteses,</hi> but they fled, and in a Rout, gave up the Passage to the Royal Forces, who pursued them with so much Vigour, that if the <hi>French</hi> Generals would, their People might have entred <hi>Susa</hi> Pell-mell with the Fugitives, but the King would not suffer it, to prevent the Pillaging of the City; the <hi>French</hi> contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a Lodgment near the Gates, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> not believing it able to defend it self, ordered the Governor to surrender the next Day. As for the Duke he retired with all haste imaginable, and was almost beset round with the Forlorn of the <hi>French</hi> Army. So the <hi>French</hi> made themselves Masters, in a few hours without any loss, of a Passage, which might have been defended against the greatest Army, if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had taken better measures, and had as much Skill in the Art of making War, as he had readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to attempt it. The Glory which he had acquired by the retreat of the Marquis <hi>d'Ʋxelles</hi> vanished quite, and he was necessitated soon after to sing another Tune altogether different to that of the proceding Year.</p>
               <p>The Eighth of <hi>March</hi> the Mareschals <hi>de Crequi</hi> and <hi>Bassompiere</hi> (for <hi>Schomberg</hi> had received a Wound by a Musquet-shot) passed the <hi>Dore,</hi> and lodged themselves at <hi>Bussolongo.</hi> The King, before he advanced further,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:187699:157"/> sent the Marquis of <hi>Seneterre</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> to Compliment his Sister the Princess of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and at <hi>Seneterre</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Mareschals who were advanced, had Orders to Enterprize nothing, till the said Marquis had spoken with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to offer him Peace, if he would agree to let the Army pass as far as <hi>Casal,</hi> and furnish it with Victuals for ready Money. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> who expected something worse, was very glad to come off so cheap, and on the Eleventh of <hi>March</hi> sent the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> to <hi>Susa,</hi> where the following Articles were agreed upon.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>The Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>promised for the present and time to come, to give free Passage through his Territories to the Armies of the King of</hi> France <hi>to go to</hi> Monferrat, <hi>and to the Relief of</hi> Casal, <hi>and furnish them with Provisions of Victuals necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He promised to suffer to be brought all Corn and other Provisions, which could be found and bought in his Country, to be put into</hi> Casal.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He promised further, to take such a Course as</hi> Don Gonzales <hi>should raise the Siege of</hi> Casal, <hi>and retire with his Troops out of</hi> Montferrat, <hi>and promised to attempt nothing for the future against the Lands of the Duke of</hi> Mantua, <hi>and should in six Weeks produce the Ratification of this Promise by his Catholick Majesty, with Engagement of his Word to leave the Duke of</hi> Mantua <hi>in the peaceable Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his Estates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He promised to enter into a League with the Pope, the King, and the Republick of</hi> Venice, <hi>and the Duke of</hi> Mantua, <hi>for the Defence of the Estate of the last, and for the Preservation of the Peace of</hi> Italy, <hi>and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe this League as soon as Three of those Potentates had subscribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>For the King's assurance of the Execution of these Promises he should put into his Majesty's Hands the Cittadel of</hi> Susa, <hi>and the Castle of</hi> St. Francis.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>The King for his part did engage to obtain for the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>from the Duke of</hi> Mantua, Trino, <hi>with Lands of Fifteen Thousand Gold Crowns of annual Revenue. Ʋntil which, his Majesty consented that the Duke should</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:187699:157"/>
                  <hi>keep what he had taken in</hi> Montferrat, <hi>on Condition that he should surrender it, when the King should restore to him the Cittadel of</hi> Susa, <hi>and the Castle of St.</hi> Francis.</p>
               <p>The King put a Garrison into these two Places, and Six days after was the Ratification of <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> brought with this Proviso, that the King of <hi>France</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he did not come into <hi>Italy</hi> to invade the States of the King his Master. The King declared it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by a Treaty of which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was <hi>Guarrantee,</hi> promised to be entirely gone out of <hi>Montferrat</hi> by the Fourth of <hi>April,</hi> and to leave the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> in Peace, whether he received Investiture from the Emperor or not.</p>
               <p>Haste was made to conclude this Treaty, because the Army wanted Provisions, the Victuallers not having been able to bring as much as they promised, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the bad ways and passing of Rivers. If the Duke and <hi>D. Gonzales</hi> had had more Vigour and better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, this one thing had been enough to Ruine the King's Army; but they were so unable to make any Resistance, and fear had so strongly seized them, that he might pass what he pleased upon them, without their being serviceable to themselves. So the Usurpers of the States of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> having had all the time which was necessary to make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and to put them in a Condition to keep what they had got, whilst the <hi>French</hi> Army was busied at the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> were driven away only by the March of the King's Army, in a time when every thing seemed as contrary to him, as favourable to the Enemies. But these are not the only Persons who have been seen, with a gaiety of Humour, to undertake an unjust War, and afterwards shamefully abandon, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, an Enterprize in which they were engaged.</p>
               <p>The King staid some time at <hi>Susa,</hi> to see the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaty, before he would repass the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, in the mean time at the <note n="*" place="margin">

P. 542. <hi>Life of</hi> Thoiras L. 2. c. 6.</note> beginning of <hi>April, Thoiras</hi> was sent away with Three Thousand Foot and and Four Hundred Horse to the Service of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to oppose any new Enterprizes which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:187699:158"/> might be made against him. The King whilst he staid at <hi>Susa,</hi> received the extraordinary Ambassadors of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and there concluded two very important Treaties. One was the League with <note n="*" place="margin">8 <hi>April.</hi>
                  </note> the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> and the Duke of <note n="*" place="margin">31 <hi>March.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Savoy,</hi> for the Preservation of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Estates, and the repose of <hi>Italy;</hi> the other was the Conclusion of a Peace with <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> I. after a great deal of Trouble and vast Expences, was obliged to make Application to the <hi>French,</hi> by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to obtain a disadvantagious Peace, which drew upon him the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Strangers, as well as of his own Subjects. He had endeavoured to accommodate Matters with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. whilst he was before <hi>Rochel,</hi> by Mediation of the Ambassadors of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the United Provinces: But Answer was given to their Ambassadors, that if they had Power from the King of <hi>England</hi> to ask a Peace for him, and to offer such Satisfactions as he ought to make to <hi>France</hi> to obtain it, a Negotiation should be entred into with them, but no otherwise. So brisk an Answer plainly shewed, that <hi>Charles</hi> was but little feared; and that he must be forc'd in the end to come to what <hi>France</hi> demanded. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by the Treaty to confirm the Articles of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the Queen's Marriage. which he had so many times broken and accepted with so much mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and which, if there was any thing to be altered for the Service of the Queen, was to be done with the Consent of both Crowns. The Treaty was Signed the 24th of <hi>April</hi> by <hi>Zorzo Zorzi</hi> and <hi>Louys Contareno</hi> Ambassadors of <hi>Venice,</hi> who were empowered from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The King before he departed from <hi>Susa,</hi> receiv'd a visit of <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> of <hi>Victor Amedeo</hi> his Son, and of the Princess of <hi>Piedmont</hi> his Spouse. After which, without tarrying for the absolute Execution of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he had just made with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he departed <note n="*" place="margin">28 <hi>April.</hi>
                  </note> from <hi>Susa,</hi> where he was uneasie, because he could not go a Hunting between those Mountains, and went to block up <hi>Privas</hi> in <hi>Vivvrets,</hi> where the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had not yet laid down their Arms, and where were the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s bravest Soldiers. He brought
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:187699:158"/> very few Troops with him, and made use at present of those the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> had already. The Cardinal staid at <hi>Susa</hi> with the greatest Part of the Army, in quality of General, and the Mareschals <hi>Crequi</hi> and <hi>Bassompiere</hi> as Lieutenant-Generals.</p>
               <p>But all things being almost executed a few days after, the <note n="*" place="margin">11 <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note> Cardinal and the Mareschal <hi>de Bassompiere</hi> repassed the Mountains with the Army, the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi</hi> remaining in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in quality of the King's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General beyond the Mountains. As soon as the Army arrived, they straitned that Place with much more Vigour. The Twenty-sixth of <hi>May</hi> the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Master of all the Outworks, after the loss of a great Number of People by the vigorous resistance of Marquis of St. <hi>Andrew Mont-brun,</hi> who had thrown himself into it. But having staid too long to Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, to obtain honourable Conditions, and it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to defend it any longer, the Garrison and the Inhabitants endeavoured to save themselves by Night in the Neighbouring Fort, and in the Mountains; which caused the King's Army entring the Town to Plunder it entirely, nor did they commit less violence against those which they found there, which happened to <hi>Negrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiss</hi> in the Presence of <hi>Lewis the Just.</hi> The Castle, in which were Four Hundred Men, surrendred also at Discretion, after they had been twice demanded to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render with safety of their Lives only, and as the King gave little Quarter to those who submitted after that manner, <note n="*" place="margin">

Though it is certain the Garrison of <hi>Privas</hi> committed a fault unpardonable, to drive things to that Extremity, yet the King who ought to have spared the Blood of his Subjects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a greater, in not offering them tolerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before they were reduced to utter Despair. But there is little Pity or Clemency in fearful, distrustful, and superstitious Souls, and the most cruel Actions are to them but small Faults, when they do not contradict their Passions.</p>
               <p>After the taking of this Place, <hi>Marillac</hi> was made Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> and the Army marched against <hi>Alets,</hi> a City of <hi>Sevennes,</hi> which after some resistance surrendred the 7th of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring in vain to relieve it. He could not hinder the taking of divers other little Places, And after this, this General of an unhappy Party, began to think seriously of an accommodation. He embraced the Opportunity which the Cardinal offered him for it, by sending an Express to him, to exhort him to return to his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if he would avoid inevitable Ruine, and expose all the Party with him to the same. They offered to him and his Brother Pardon for what was passed, the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Goods, and Liberty of Conscience to all the Hugonots, on condition that the Fortifications of <hi>Nimes, Castres d'Ʋzes</hi> and <hi>Montauban,</hi> which were not yet in the King's Power, should be demolished. This Treaty was Signed at <hi>Alets</hi> the 27th of <hi>June.</hi> And the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> could never obtain to be admitted to throw himself at the King's Feet, though he had treated with the Cardinal about it.

               <p> The King and the Cardinal having received the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of the Queen-Mother, were extreamly angry at the violent manner with which she had satisfied her Passion against <hi>Mary de Gonzaga.</hi> In the Interim they thought fit to dissemble it, outwardly approved what she had done, and gave Orders in the mean time for the managing of Monsieur, that he might not be driven into Despair by so rude a treatment. All <hi>France</hi> also thought it very hard, that the Queen-Mother was so obstinately bent against the Marriage of the Prince with that Princess, and that she took upon her such an Authority in the State, as to arrest the Daughter of a Sovereign Prince unknown to the King. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Queen-Mother, naturally obstinate, continued firm to her first Resolutions, though she saw the Court disapproved the excessive Passion, which she shewed to have Monsieur Married to the Princess of <hi>Florence.</hi> The Cardinal, who had laid the Foundations of his own Authority more solidly than on the bare Favour of the Queen-Mother, by the Reduction of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the Delivering of <hi>Casal,</hi> had no further Necessity of her for the the maintenance of his Power, yet had reason to fear, lest she should become too great, and augment the Aversion which the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> had for him, if he should too violently oppose his Desires. Upon this Consideration he did not give himself the trouble to cross the Designs of the Queen-Mother's Enemies, who failed not to represent to the King, that this Princess sought only her own Interest in this Affair, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the Sentiment of all <hi>France,</hi> to whom the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Affection did not appear so unreasonable. The Queen perceiving with what Coldness the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal espoused her Interests, began to hate him more heartily than ever she had loved him.</p>
               <p>The King having repassed the Mountains, and the Cardinal quickly following him, as I have before said, his Majesty thought it to little purpose to detain the Princesses any longer Prisoners at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and the Cardinal also openly declared the same, which raised the Queen-Mother's Indignation to an excessive heighth against him.

               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:187699:164"/>
               <p> She said, that the Cardinal was become so insolent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1629"/> that he had let her understand, that it was now time that she might be contented to depend on him: That he had said, <hi>That for all her Choler against him, he would not cease to be her Servant, and do her all good offices with the King her Son, which she stood in need of; because People did not stick to say, that she thought of nothing but the continuance of her own authority, though with the disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Majesty's, and that by her excessive rigour she had constrained Monsieur to withdraw himself:</hi> she also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Cardinal had said, <hi>that she ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that she might stand in need of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another time, as she affirmed, the Cardinal would have surprized her, by telling her, <hi>That since she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in honour to exclude</hi> Mary de Gonzaga, <hi>yet she was not to be counselled to consent to it, but that to appease the Duke of</hi> Orleans, <hi>and to hinder the Kingdom's thinking it strange, that all things he desir'd were denied him, she might reasonably shut her Eyes, and permit, without giving her consent, that Monsieur might privately marry that Princess, because she might gain this advantage by it, that if she should have no Children, as the Queen-Mother was always of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would be easie to declare that marriage null, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely dissolve it.</hi> But the Queen-Mother had rejected with reason that Counsel, because she said the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Princess of <hi>Mantua</hi> being very incertain if she had Children, doubt might be made of their Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which might cause great disturbances.</p>

All the world was convinced that the Queen-Mother sought to Reign as long as she lived, and assumed too much authority over her Sons.

               <p>During this, the Duke of <hi>Bellegard</hi> returned to the Court, on the behalf of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain something for him, and to intreat the Queen-Mother not to be reconciled with the Cardinal, of whom Monsieur was absolutely resolved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged; He also bad him tell her, that he would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouse what Princess her Majesty pleased.

               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal being in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the Emperor sent the Count <hi>de Merode</hi> with sixteen thousand Foot and two thousand Horse to demand of the three Leagued <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>

The Count enter'd into the Country of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> took <hi>Coire,</hi> and put himself into a Condition to enter the <hi>Milaneze</hi> by the <hi>Valteline. Italy</hi> was extreamly surprized to see an Imperial Army, to execute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of an Emperor, which was despised before, because not maintained by force, The Emperor sent at the same time a Circulary Letter to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> dated the 9th of <hi>June,</hi> 1629. in the which he declared the motives which induced him to send an Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> which were the divers pretenders to the Dutchy's of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who had filled <hi>Italy</hi> with Troops, for whose repose he was obliged to labour; the Journey of the King of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with an Army; and the authority he had taken to make Treaties about the Fiefs which depended on the Empire, and to render himself Arbiter of the concerns, which could not be determined but by his Imperial Majesty. These reasons had obliged the Emperor to send an Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> to maintain his Rights, and create all due obedience to his decrees. <hi>Ambrosio Spinola,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained some time in <hi>Spain,</hi> was also gone to take the Government of the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> and the conduct of the Spanish Forces in that Country.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:187699:165"/>
               <p> Upon news of this, the Cardinal, to keep those advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which he had lately gotten over the Spaniard, was resolved to send, as soon as possible, new succours to the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> Orders were sent to the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who was at <hi>Turin,</hi> to know of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> after what manner he pretended to Govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in this conjuncture, and whether he would assist the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as he was by the Treaty of <hi>Susa</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do. <hi>Thoiras</hi> also was ordered to retire to <hi>Cazal</hi> and <hi>Ponzone</hi> with the French Troops▪ which were spread up and down in divers places of <hi>Montferrat:</hi> and to the Ambassadors of the Crown with the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and more especially to him who was at <hi>Venice,</hi> to forget nothing which might induce them to oppose the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of the Imperialists and Spaniards.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> instead of disposing himself to observe the Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Susa,</hi> re-demanded that place of the King, by his Ambassador, feigning to be intirely for the Interests of <hi>France,</hi> but they were persuaded of the contrary, and so took no heed of granting what he demanded. The Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> and the Pope's Nuncio made divers Propositions; but as the Imperialists and the Spaniards sought for nothing but to seize on the States of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to keep them in Deposit, until the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had adjudged the Process which was between the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> and <hi>Guastalla</hi> all those Negotiations were unprofitable. From this time <hi>Julio Mazarini,</hi> who was afterwards Cardinal, took great pains to prevent things from coming to an open rupture.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Rambold,</hi> Count of <hi>Collalto,</hi> who was to Command the Imperial Army, arrived in the <hi>Millaneze.</hi> He wrote to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that if he would not willingly obey the decree of the Emperor, he had orders to enter with his Army, and take possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Estates. He was resolved to make an Invasion into the Dutchy of <hi>Mantua</hi> with ten thousand Men, and to send about six thousand into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counting the Troops which he expected in the Country of the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

This Advice was followed, and the Imperialists, after a new Publication of the Emperor's Decree, entred upon the Lands of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and put all into a Fright and Consternation. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, little acquainted with War, durst not resist, nor had they so much precaution as to save their effects.</p>

                  <hi>Spinola,</hi> of his side, entering into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> seized of <hi>Aiqui,</hi> of <hi>Ponzon,</hi> of <hi>Roque Vignal,</hi> of <hi>Nissa de la Paille,</hi> the French having abandoned all but <hi>Cazal</hi> and <hi>Pontesture,</hi> to which they reduced the Defence of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat.</hi>

The Garison of <hi>Gazzuolo</hi> would have
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:187699:166"/> assassinated their Governor <hi>Monteret,</hi> if he would not have Surrender'd, which he was <note n="*" place="margin">28 <hi>Octob.</hi>
                  </note> forced to do, though he had provisions for many Months, and the Place strong enough. <hi>Governolo</hi> was two days after taken by Storm, and the People, which were no way accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to War, submitted every where to the Imperial Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aldringhen</hi> and <hi>Galat,</hi> Sergeant of Battel in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Army, being approach'd to <hi>Mantua,</hi> though it was extream bad weather, and the excessive Dirt of the Mantuan had made the ways unpassable, began to form the Siege of <hi>Mantua.</hi> This place was ill provided, and the Italian Soldiers so Raw and ill Disciplined, that the Germans made their Approaches, and took divers Posts without any great loss. Yet could they not hinder a Venetian Convoy from getting in, with some French Officers, which gave some Courage to the Duke, who knew not which way to turn himself. The Nuntio <hi>Pancirolo</hi> and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> would have proposed a Cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms, but it was not possible to perswade the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists, who believed they should be Masters of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> in a few days. They gave an Assault to the City, the 27th of <hi>November,</hi> but were repulsed. It appeared by this Siege that the places which the Imperialists had already taken in the State of <hi>Mantua</hi> had not fallen so easily into their hands, but by the Cowardice of the Commanders or Troops which were there: since <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> which was neither well provided, nor well Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, escaped them, since it had some Officers within and some few Foreign Troops able to resist.</p>
               <p>Whilst things passed thus in <hi>Italy,</hi> the French Forces marched towards <hi>Susa,</hi> and the King had designed the Cardinal to command them.

                  <hi>whosoever, that would not entertain Peace; and that she would never flee from it, wherefore his Catholick Majesty must know that he left him to his liberty to chuse Peace or War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, the Army being already in <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> strong twenty thousand Foot and two thousand Horse, the King caused Letters-Patents to be passed to the Cardinal dated the 24th of <hi>December,</hi> in which after an Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of this Prelate, he gave him the Title of <hi>Lieutenant General, representing the person of the King,</hi> which was never before given to any whatsoever. It was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to receive and hear the Ambassadors of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Deputies of Towns and Communities, and to send them, as he should judge necessary for the Service of the King. His Enemies said, to render him odious, that the King had divested himself of all his Authority in favour of the Cardinal, and reserved nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self but the power of Curing the Evil. It was for him the new word <hi>Generalissimo</hi> was invented, to distinguish him more easily from the Mareschals <hi>Crequi, Schomberg,</hi> and <hi>de la Force,</hi> who were to serve under him in quality of Lieutenant-Generals.</p>
               <p>He left <hi>Paris</hi> the 29th of <hi>December,</hi> and mounted in a Coach, accompanied by the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> in one Boot, and the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals <hi>Bassompiere</hi> and <hi>Schomberg</hi> in the other, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cavaliers of Persons of the greatest Quality at Court accompanied him about a mile and a half from <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Guards attended with eight Troops of the Regiment of Guards of three hundred Men each. Those who were to bid a-dieu having taken leave, he took the Road to <hi>Lyons,</hi> with a small Flying Camp, which the King had given him for the safe-Guard of his Person.</p>
               <p>Some Months before his Departure, the Cardinal had the pleasure to understand that <hi>Ʋrban</hi> VIII. had given a Hat to his Brother the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> whom he had taken out of a Cloyster to give him that Arch-Bishoprick, and another to the Nuncio <hi>Bagni,</hi> who was his particular Friend, insomuch that it seemed that all the world strove to honour his Family, and to show him their good wills.</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:187699:167"/>
               <p> The Cardinal arrived at <hi>Lyons</hi> the 18th of <hi>January,</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1630"/> the year 1630, from whence he sent <hi>Servien</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to give him notice that he approached the Frontiers with an Army of thirty thousand Men to succour the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and therefore expected, according to the Treaty of <hi>Suze,</hi> that the Duke gave him passage through his Estates, and joyned his Army with his, as he had a little before told him he would, by his Ambassador the President of <hi>Montfalcon.</hi> The Duke denied to have given any such Order to his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, and said, that the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> was gone to <hi>Pont de Beauvoisin,</hi> where he might confer with the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>Three Days after the arrival of this Prelate at <hi>Lyons,</hi> the Count <hi>de St. Maurice</hi> came on behalf of the Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who was already at <hi>Pont de Beauvoisin,</hi> to offer to give passage to the Army, through the Estates of his Father, and to intreat the Cardinal to come to the same place to confer with him touching the march of the Army. The Cardinal answered, that he would Advise with the Mareschals, and some other Lords who were at <hi>Lyons</hi> with him▪ about it. In effect, he sent to find the Mareschals <hi>Bassompiere</hi> and <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and <hi>de la Force,</hi> beside the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Alincourt,</hi> Governor of <hi>Lyons.</hi>

                     <hi>Bassomp. Mem.</hi> T. 2. P. 584.</note> This last said, that he perceived no inconvenience which could be, if he did what the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> desired. The Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> who gave his Opinion after him, said, that for many reasons he thought it not fit that the Cardinal should go to <hi>Pont de Beauvoisin;</hi> That it would look as if he went to seek the Prince, because of the desire he had to have Peace, and that the Spaniards who knew it would make none, but with conditions advantageous to them; That the Proposition of the Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> was but an Artifice to delay the march of the King's Army, and the Execution of his designs; That it was from Vanity that the Spaniards, who so much desired Peace with the French, would that it should be Treated of, before the Army of <hi>France</hi> was gone out of the Realm, that it might clearly declare the intention of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who play'd too much the Neuter on
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:187699:168"/> this occasion, and because of this he would Negotiate a Place which was half to the King, and half to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He was of Opinion that the Cardinal should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That having Affairs at <hi>Lyons</hi> for Eight Days, and being indisposed he could not go unto <hi>Pont de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voisin:</hi> but if the Prince would come to <hi>Lyons</hi> he should be treated according to his Quality: That if he could not come, the Cardinal would see him at <hi>Chambery</hi> as he went into <hi>Italy,</hi> if he would stay for him there. The Mareschal <hi>de la Force</hi> was of the same Opinion, and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> likewise approved it.</p>
               <p>The Mareschal <hi>de Bassompiere</hi> was nevertheless of the contrary Sentiment, that at least if he had not some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Reasons, for which he would not hear any speech of Peace, he apprehended nothing why the Cardinal should refuse to go to <hi>Pont de Beauvoisin;</hi> That the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> was a Prince affectionate to <hi>France,</hi> Brother-in-Law to the King, and who came fifty Leagues through most bitter cold to propose things to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, which might be advantageous to the Crown; That the Cardinal went not out of his way, and in case that they came to no conclusion, he ought to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> that he might refuse or accept the Propositions when he had heard them; that this proceeding of the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> might give occasion to believe that the Spaniards sought Peace, since they had so ordered matters, that the Prince came to meet the General of the French Army; That it was glorious for the King, that they came to offer at his own Frontiers all they could agree to, if he were in the <hi>Milaneze</hi> with a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant Army. That it was rather an effect of the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then of the Vanity of the Spaniards, that there could not be demanded of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> a more Express Declaration than what he made the precedent year, when he had ordered it to be said by his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador, that if the King would enter into an open War with <hi>Spain,</hi> he should joyn ten thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse to the King's Army; That <hi>France</hi> not declaring it self openly, it was not to be exacted from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to do so: It is true, that the <hi>Pont de Beauvoisin</hi> separated <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Savoy,</hi> but the Prince of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:187699:168"/>
                  <hi>Piemont</hi> would make it no difficulty to come on the King's Lands to treat with the Cardinal, who would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to his Dignity, nor contrary to that of the Crown by going to meet him there. That it was an advantage that the Conclusion, or breach of the Peace, should be made by the intermission of the Prince of <hi>Piemont,</hi> because the King might relax some things in his favour; and if nothing were concluded, all <hi>Europe</hi> would judge that the Conditions which the Spaniards had proposed, were very unreasonable, since at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of his Brother-in-Law the King would not accept them.</p>
               <p>It seems that the Cardinal would hear this second ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, because it was for his Interest to make a speedy conclusion, that he might speedily return to the Court, where they endeavoured to do him ill Offices with the King; nevertheless he followed the Counsel of the Mareschal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> which agreed most with his Vanity.</p>
               <p>He wrote to the King, that he approved of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 12.</note> and forbad him to give any hearing of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions might be made to him concerning a simple suspension of Arms. He was absolutely for a ready and assured Peace or a War. If the Emperor would grant the Investiture of his Estates to the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would let him enjoy it in Peace, <hi>France</hi> would think no more of carrying their Arms into <hi>Italy,</hi> and there was no time more fit, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his Army's passing the Mountains.</p>
               <p>As there was no such Proposition made on the behalf of the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> the Cardinal left <hi>Lyons</hi> on the 28th of <hi>January,</hi> to take his way to <hi>Suze.</hi> He sent <hi>L'Emery</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to amuse him by some Propositions, for fear that being provok'd against <hi>France,</hi> and despairing of a Reconciliation with her he should joyn himself with the Imperialists and Spaniards. If the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> should do this, then the French Army was to begin with the attack of <hi>Piemont,</hi> lest it should leave a formidable Army behind it when it should be in <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and in the mean time the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> would run the risque to be trod down.</p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:187699:169"/>
               <p> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having received the Answer, which the Cardinal had made to the Marquis of <hi>St. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> was in an extream rage to find his Son slighted after that manner. But the Cardinal excused himself on the account that it was not for the Dignity of the King, to Treat with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> as his equal, as he would seem to have done, if his Minister had gone to the Frontiers, and to a place named by the Prince of <hi>Piemont.</hi> Although the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had little reason to be satisfied with this put-off of the Cardinals, yet he omitted not to send his Son near to <hi>Suze,</hi> where he had divers conferences with this Minister. <note n="*" place="margin">Aubery <hi>Life of the Card.</hi> lib. 3. c. 17.</note> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosed to the Cardinal to Attack the Republick of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> at the same time, and offered to joyn the Troops of his Father with those of the King, and to furnish all he could raise from his Estates; and also to give him places for security. The Cardinal rejected all these Propositions as nothing to the purpose, and required that the Duke should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently assign Estates, that the Army might march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Montferrat,</hi> where the Places for want of Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sufficient Garisons run great hazard to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Spaniards.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> pressed by the Cardinal, mark'd the Roads for the Army through his Estates, and the places where they might find Victuals paying for them; the Army advanced to <hi>Condovi,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelleta,</hi> where, instead of finding Victuals, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extream Want, which hindred its further pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. Whilst it sojourned there, the Cardinal having received advice, that <hi>Casal</hi> and <hi>Pondesture</hi> had received each a considerable Convoy of Victuals, which was what those places principally wanted, he sent one to carry his last Resolution to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him forthwith to declare himself; which was, that if he would joyn his Troops to the French Army, his Majesty would <hi>give him the Valley of Cisery,</hi> and the <hi>Pont de Gresin,</hi> would maintain for him five thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse, and also joyn with him for the recovery of what the <hi>Genoeses</hi> detained. The Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> came to find the Cardinal, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:187699:169"/> the Proposals which he had caused to be made to his Father; but he said, that not being yet reconciled with the Genoueses, he had a design to bring them to reason, and that was what hinder'd him to joyn the Royal Army.</p>
               <p>This Answer created an Apprehension, That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> only designed to gain time, which was not to be given him. The French Generals then concluded to declare War against him, if he executed not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the Treaty of <hi>Suze.</hi> They sent to tell him, that by the Treaty, the King's Army was to have free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through <hi>Piemont</hi> to go to <hi>Montferrat.</hi> It was just that the Duke should raze the Fortifications of <hi>Veillane,</hi> which is a place upon the Passage, which the Duke had Fortified about a year since, and put a strong Garison therein. It was not prudence for them to leave that place in that condition behind them, in the uncertainty they were in of what the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> might do. The Duke only offered to withdraw part of his forces from <hi>Veillane,</hi> but would hear nothing of razing the Fortifications of a place, which was so far in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In the mean time, he seized the principal Passes of the River <hi>Dore,</hi> as if he would oppose the march of the King's Army. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7.

The Horse were to pass first, and the Infantry to follow them over a Bridge at a great distance. The Cardinal had a design to surprize the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was at <hi>Rivoli,</hi> a House of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and suddenly to Invest that place, before the Duke could get out, after which he might make him do what he thought fit To execute this design more easily, the Cardinal sent a Gentleman to the Duke, to tell him, that the King's Army could stay no longer where it was without prejudice; and that he intreated him to dispose all things so, as that it might pass conveniently and without further delay, otherwise he should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:187699:170"/> to force his Passage, and to provide, as he should find it necessary, subsistance for the Army. The Duke on his side <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery Life of the Card.</hi> Lib. 3. c. 17.</note> sent his Son the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reason of the Countermarch of the Vanguard, which came back the way it went. The Cardinal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that as he had not informed himself of the reason of some motions which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had caused his Troops to make, so was he not obliged to give an account, why he had caused the Vanguard to approach nearer to the rest of the Army.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, the design we spoke of was to be Executed, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being much inferior in number of Troops, would have been infallibly taken. if he had not in the Night retired to <hi>Turin,</hi> be it that he was advertised of the Cardinal's design, or that he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it: The Cardinal <note n="*" place="margin">

The Officer replied, Yes; but it is the Custom of Soldiers whilst they are suffering, but they always said the contrary when they were at ease. In the sequel, he told the Cardinal, that he would advise them to be wiser when he gave them Orders. The Army being come to <hi>Rivoli</hi> the Cardinal was lodg'd in the Castle in the middle of the Town; the Soldiers having found plenty of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, began to solace themselves for the Fatigue they had that day had, and the Cardinal understood they were very merry, and drank a Health to this great Cardinal <hi>Richelieu:</hi> The Officer going afterwards to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from him, because then the Guards received them from the General alone, or the King when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Person; the Cardinal told him, that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had much changed their discourse, and thought it to no purpose to punish them.</p>

They used so much diligence that the next day a Battery of three pieces of Cannon begun to play, which made those of the City, which might have held out several days, to surrender. The Cardinal entred into the Town, and began to attack the Castle. The Count <hi>Ʋrban d'Escalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> Governor of the Place, was retired into it with eight hundred men: at the same time they worked on Lines of Contravallation, fearing they should be long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Castle, which being on a Rock, seemed almost to be impregnable. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Memoirs of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mareschal</hi> de Plessis, <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> The Count <hi>de Plessis Praslain</hi> Master of the Camp, had orders to build a Fort on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> to stop relief which might come that way, they fixed a † Miner to one of the Bastions, which was on so hard a Rock, that in <hi>three</hi> days he scarcely made a hole would cover half a Man. During this, the Governor, who had no experience in the Art-Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, <note place="margin">‡ <hi>Puysegar. Mem.</hi> p. 68.</note> fancied himself with the Garison ready to fly into the Air, and on <hi>Easter-Eve,</hi> when no such thing was expected, he beat a Parley. The Cardinal who had notice, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was advancing to relieve the place, immediately sent the Mareschal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> to agree with the Governor on his own terms, provided he went out in four hours. But the Devout Governor said, he would not depart till the morrow morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would absolutely communicate in his place, before he surrender'd it. All they could draw out of him, was that it should be early in the morning, and that he would give Hostages, In the mean time the Cardinal, who feared every moment to have the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> on his back, and that might inspire new Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage into the Cowardly Governor, grew impatient, and caused in the Night the Clocks of the Town to be set an hour forward, to hasten <hi>Escalangue;</hi> when day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Escalangue</hi> after receiving the Sacrament, with the greatest part of the Garison went out of the place. The Garison took their way to <hi>Turin,</hi> but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor stayed behind to dispatch some affairs which he had.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:187699:171"/> These Troops about a League from the Town met the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was coming to relieve <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and was so inraged at their Cowardice, that he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cavalry to lay hands on them. He should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have prevented this Mischief, by putting into <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol</hi> a Man of War, instead of <hi>Escalangue:</hi> and he was blamed by all the War, for putting the Keys of his Estate into the hands of a Man who was unable to keep them. Thus <hi>France</hi> obtained a Passage from <hi>Dauphiné</hi> into <hi>Piedmont</hi> which she would never since part with, and by means of which she hath ever since held the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> in Dependance, or hinder'd them from taking Arms against her and escaping unpunished.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal who knew the Importance of keeping this place, took care to fortify it regularly, and to place a good Garison in it. Although he had prevalent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to return into <hi>France</hi> as soon as possible, yet he would not leave <hi>Pignerol</hi> before he had put it in a state of Defence. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 66.</note> When he sent an Express to the King to carry him the news of this Conquest, he gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Reasons which he had engaged him to break with the Duke, the Principal whereof was that he would not observe the Treaty of <hi>Susa.</hi> Had these Reasons been weak, yet the taking of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> on which the Crown had antient pretensions, would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them of very great moment, and the King could not but approve of the Conduct of his Minister.</p>
               <p>The Pope and the Venetians were not angry, that <hi>France</hi> had gotten an open Passage into <hi>Italy,</hi> to held <hi>Savoy</hi> to his Duty, and more easily to oppose the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> But it was feared that the rupture with <hi>Savoy,</hi> would stop the French Arms in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and that in the mean time <hi>Casal</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> would fall into the hands of the Imperialists and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards. To prevent this, the Cardinal <hi>Antonio Barbarino</hi> Legat, and the Ambassadors of <hi>Venice</hi> pressed the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal to make an accommodation with <hi>Savoy,</hi> but this accommodation was the more difficult, because the Duke insisted absolutely for the Restoration of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which it was to be feared <hi>France</hi> would never consent to.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:187699:172"/>
               <p> For this the Legat <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The 7th of</hi> April. <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 72.</note> went to <hi>Pignerol</hi> to visit the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and see if he could persuade him to restore this place. The Cardinal told him, <hi>That he had no power, because the King had but scarcely received news of its taking. That as he could not give neither his word nor assurance, that the place should be restored, so would he not put them out of all hopes: that they might employ their endeavours with the King to obtain it, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the intercession of the Princess of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>might be of very great weight, especially if they demanded the restitution of this place, not upon any convention but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an effect of the King's generosity.</hi> The Legat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thereupon, that to make the Peace more easily, <hi>France</hi> ought to give her word that she would restore <hi>Pignerol,</hi> for the consideration she had for the Princess of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Cardinal answered to this, <hi>That he had no power to give it, and that should the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to restore</hi> Pignerol, <hi>he knew not why he should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise before hand, what he was only obliged to do out of his own generosity. But as soon as he knew the King's intention he would not fail to let him know it.</hi> The Legat after proposed a suspension of Arms, and the Cardinal replied, <hi>That if that could produce the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Peace, as the Legat might know from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards and the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>he would voluntarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to the Council, and would not be an Enemy to that advice; but if this suspension were not made for that end, it would be to no purpose to speak of it,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pressed oftentime▪ to tell what he thought of the restitution of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> he said, <hi>That he believed the King's intention was not to appropriate that place to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but that the King might design to keep it, until all the Articles of Peace were compleatly executed, because he had no other security for the execution of the Treaty.</hi> The Father <hi>Valerian</hi> a Capuchin, made moreover many Propositions, but the Cardinal remained firm to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, and as they knew the King intirely depended on his Counsels, they found it would be no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to get <hi>Pignerol</hi> out of his hands, and by consequence to come to any conclusion. The French thought it strange, that <hi>Ʋrban</hi> the VIII. should send his Nephew,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:187699:172"/> to treat on such a difficult affair as this, instead of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cardinal of Age and Experience.</p>
               <p>So that nothing was concluded, the Mareschal of <hi>Schomberg</hi> advanced <note n="*" place="margin">4 <hi>April.</hi>
                  </note> about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> as far as <hi>Briqueras,</hi> and as <hi>Spinolo, Collalto,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> opposed themselves to his passage, he durst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further; so that the design of relieving the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> of which the Cardinal made so much noise, and which was the occasion of the King's Army passing the Mountains, vanished, since <hi>France</hi> had found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to pay it self for the charge she had been at.</p>
               <p>The King, that he might be near to his Armies, came with the Queen and all the Court to <hi>Lyons</hi> the 4th of <hi>May,</hi> where he received news from the Cardinal which informed him, that after he had put <hi>Pignerol</hi> in a state of Defence, he would be ready to attend him. The Mareschal <hi>de Bassompiere</hi> who had been sent into <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> to raise six thousand men there, returned, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving executed his Commission. A Council was kept, and it was concluded, to make the Conquest of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to counterbalance that way the advantages which the Imperialists and the Spaniards had made on the Estates of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to whom no further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position could be made, by reason of the difficulty of the Passages. The 14th of <hi>May</hi> was appointed for the Rendezvous of the Army which was to be between <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble</hi> and the <hi>Fort de Barraut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10th of the same Month the King parted from <hi>Lyons</hi> to go to <hi>Grenoble,</hi> whither the Cardinal was come the day before. The King arrived the 12th, and the Cardinal having related to him what had passed in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> went to <hi>Lyons</hi> to salute the Queens. He gave all manner of respects to their Majesties, and it was believed he would not have made this journey, but only to endeavour a perfect reconciliation with the Queen-Mother. This Princess Exhorted him very much to a Peace, and he seemed to be well inclined to make it, if it could be done with honour. There was no design formed against the States of the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> no transactions were set on foot but for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and by the same means to support the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The Cardinal also seemed
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:187699:173"/> absolutely reconciled with the Queen-Mother, to whom he made great submissions, and she for her part showed not any resentment for what had passed.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal was afterwards to find the King again, who in a little time subjected all <hi>Savoy</hi> with an Army of eighteen thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse. In the mean time, <hi>Mazarine</hi> came in quality of a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, to treat of Peace, and the Cardinal offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store <hi>Pignerol,</hi> but on so hard terms, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 81.</note> that there was no appearance that the House of <hi>Austria</hi> would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them. The Conquest of <hi>Savoy,</hi> nevertheless, proved not of so great consequence to facilitate a Peace as was expected; and <hi>Collalto</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> receiving every day new Troops, put themselves in posture to invade the <hi>Mantuan</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> without any one that was in a Condition to withstand them. All the French Nation being wearied with continual Wars, in which they had been for so long time engaged either at Home or Abroad. The new Impositions which had been laid on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for carrying on the Wars, render'd them disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: there had been some Seditious in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Commotion at <hi>Lyons,</hi> although the Queens were present, the People refusing to pay the new Taxes. The Garison of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and the Troops in <hi>Piedmont</hi> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infinitely for want of Victuals. <hi>Troiras,</hi> who was in <hi>Casal,</hi> wholly wanted Money, and was obliged to Coin Copper, with promise to save all Persons from Damage by it, who should receive it, as soon as the City should be disingaged. If in this conjuncture, the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> had proposed tollerable conditions, a Peace had easily followed, though before there was no talk of War. The Cardinal had always this maxim to make advantage by the present state of affairs, and as the condition of things changed, he often changed his Counsels, and abandoned his principal designs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he found in the execution any thing equivalent.</p>
               <p>In the interim, he furnished <hi>Thoiras</hi> with 30000 Crowns to pay the Garison of <hi>Casal,</hi> for fear lest for want of Money that Town should fall into the hands of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aubery Life of the Card.</hi> Lib. 3. c. 22.</note> About this time the Pope made a Decree, by which, instead of the title of <hi>Illustrissimo,</hi> or most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <note place="margin">* 10 June</note>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:187699:173"/> Lordship, the Cardinals were to receive that of Eminence, or most Eminent. The Decree being sent to all the Cardinals, they were not wanting to make their advantages by it, and they treated the French Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals as well as the others, only with that of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. It was said, that Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of this new Title, but had no small share in its Invention.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Philippo Spinola,</hi> Son of the Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> at the beginning of this Spring took <hi>Pondesture,</hi> ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the French, and four other small places; so that there remained no more than <hi>Casal,</hi> which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> by the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Thoiras</hi> who was always in the place. The Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> formed the Siege the 23 of <hi>May</hi> with an Army of Eighteen thousand Foot and six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse. <hi>Thoiras</hi> made great and continual Sallies which incommoded the besiegers, but so weakned his Garison; The Germans began at the same time to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack <hi>Mantua;</hi> where-into the Mareschal <hi>d'Estree,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before had thrown himself, without Money, or Forces; so that he was of little use to the Duke. The Venetians succoured that place so slowly and weakly, and a great part of the Inhabitants loving rather to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Emperor than endure a longer War, it was taken, and the Duke obliged to Surrender the Citadel of <hi>Porto</hi> on the 18th of <hi>July.</hi> From thence he retired into the Ecclesiastical State, having been able to save nothing but his Person: and had it not been for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity of the Neighbouring Princes, he had wanted all things most necessary to support Life: We are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that since the beginning of the Siege there died in <hi>Mantua,</hi> above twenty five thousand Persons of the Siege and of other Inconveniences, but the Avarice of the Germans who entred it, caused yet greater mischief, there being not a house, which they plunder'd not of all things they had a mind to, nor any insolence which they did not commit. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally blamed, who sold and engaged the Lands which he had in <hi>France</hi> for above four hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns, and disposed of the greatest parts of the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:187699:174"/> rich moveables which he found in the Palace of the Dukes of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to support himself in this War, and yet notwithstanding did nothing requisite for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of his State, not having so much as an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Garison in <hi>Mantua,</hi> nor having taken the pains to Fortify it. It was thought strange, that the Venetians had not better succoured it, being so much concerned as they were; But what was more surprizing was, that <hi>France,</hi> which had declared highly for him, acquitted her self so ill, of what she had promised him, doing nothing but what was done for the Relief of <hi>Casal.</hi> The Cardinal accounted the taking of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> to be a thing infinitely more important than the Succour of <hi>Mantua,</hi> in which there was more of glory than of present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Crown.</p>
               <p>He had, during this, entertained commerce with the Princes, who composed the Protestant League in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and who opposed themselves to the Grandeur of the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> It was this year that <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> passed into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and the King having sent the Baron <hi>de Charnaces</hi> to him, to propose a League between the two Crowns, the Cardinal wrote to him <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The Army of the Mareschals <hi>de la Force</hi> and <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> being very much enfeebled by Desertions, and by Sicknesses, required of necessity to be reinforced with a new body of an Army, and the Conduct thereof was given to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>d'Effiat.</hi> It was composed of ten thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse, and to joyn the other Army <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:187699:174"/> commanded by the Prince <hi>Thoiras.</hi> The French being to pass a Defile, the Savoyards staid till all were passed, but the Rear-Guard, which they charged and put them presently into confusion; but the two French Generals having caused some of their Troops to turn back, they defeated the Savoyards, and laid near two thousand Men on the ground. <note n="*" place="margin">20 <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> A few days after they took the City of <hi>Saluces,</hi> by composition, which made the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> much perplexed. Being come to <hi>Savigliano,</hi> with design to repair the loss by a new Combat, because he was superior in Horse, he received the news of the taking of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which as much rejoyced him as it afflicted the French.</p>
               <p>In this conjuncture, wherein <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> had more reason to be sorry than to rejoyce, his grief and <note place="margin">* 26 <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> joy finished his Life. He was a Prince of a vast Spirit, and undaunted Courage, but extraordinarily ambitious and turbulent, and who rarely took just measures to compass the enterprises in which he engaged himself. He is likewise accused to have been unconstant, faithless, and also cruel, for they shewed divers Castles in his Estates where he had secretly put to death those he would be rid of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Victor Amedeus</hi> his Eldest Son, Brother-in-Law to <hi>Louys</hi> XIII. succeeded him, and it was believed, that the strict Alliance which was between them would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them quickly to a Peace, and that the new Duke would recover his Estates, more by the Generosity of the King than by way of Arms. But the Politick Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was entirely opposite to this kind of generosity. The French Generals having understood the Death of <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> deliberated whether they should go to <hi>Casal,</hi> whilst the courage of the Savoyards was abated by the Death of their Prince. But the major part were of opinion, that they should remain in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they contented themselves to go to <hi>Revel,</hi> where the Plague began to kill many People. From thence they went to <hi>Villa Franca</hi> and to <hi>Pontcalier,</hi> whose Castles they took by composition. Their Cavalry soon after possessed themselves of <hi>Carignan,</hi> and the Savoyards which were there, passed quickly over the <hi>Po,</hi> and took
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:187699:175"/> away the Planks of the Bridge that they might not be followed by the French. The new Duke came thither almost at the same time, to relieve his Subjects, and made them work on a Retrenchment beyond the Bridge to cover his Troops and secure his passage; afterwards he made a Half Moon on that side the Bridge, a work which the French at first despised, but it being finished made them afraid that when they had a mind to retire from <hi>Carignan,</hi> they should be attack'd by the Savoyards because there was <hi>a</hi> Defile to pass; they therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to attack it, <note n="*" place="margin">7 <hi>August</hi>
                  </note> which they did with so much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour that they took it with Sword in hand, and killed near two thousand of the Duke's men, who again took away the Planks of the Bridge. This action of the French was nevertheless not advantageous to them, and they durst not march to <hi>Casal</hi> fearing the Army of <hi>Spinola</hi> was re-inforced with German Troops, which had been before in the <hi>Mantua,</hi> after that <hi>Mantua</hi> was taken. He pressed <hi>Casal</hi> daily more and more, and though <hi>Thoiras</hi> did all he could to defend it, he had no hopes to keep it longer than <hi>September,</hi> because he wanted both Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Money, and the Soldiers were extraordinarily diminished: besides that, the Inhabitants of <hi>Casal</hi> which found themselves yet the strongest, had been wearied with three years War, and two Sieges which they had undergone, had declared that they intended to Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> if the Siege were not raised before. <hi>Thoiras</hi> wrote this ill news to the French Generals, but their Army was so lessened by the Plague, and so full of Sicknesses, that they looked upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Casal</hi> as a thing impossible. Notwithstanding <hi>Spinola</hi> was in an extraordinary fear, lest they should march for this against his Trenches, because the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand Men with which he began the Siege, were by sickness reduced to four, and because no quarter was given by either side.</p>
               <p>In this confusion of both Parties, <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who took the function of the Nuntio <hi>Pancirolo,</hi> after many Journeys which he made to no purpose on either side to induce them to a Peace, obtained in fine, that they should sign a General Truce from the 4th of <hi>September</hi> to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:187699:175"/> the fifteenth of <hi>October.</hi> It was in this Treaty among other things agreed that <hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>Thoiras,</hi> should leave all works, either for the attacking or defending of <hi>Casal,</hi> in the same Estate they were, that <hi>Spinola</hi> should give leave to the French Garison to buy Victuals in his Camp unto the end of <hi>October,</hi> that they should in the mean time remit to the Spaniards the City and Castle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal:</hi> that if the Peace were not concluded by the 15th of the same Month, the French might endeavour to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the Citadel of <hi>Casal;</hi> but if they were not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured before the last day, <hi>Thoiras</hi> should resign it to <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Suspension of Arms seemed strange to those, who knew not the Condition of both Parties, because it seemed to them that <hi>Spinola</hi> must necessarily carry the Citadel of <hi>Casal,</hi> or that the French must raise the siege. But <hi>Spinola</hi> who could not force the Citadel, because his Army was diminished more than two thirds, and that he could obtain no assistance from <hi>Collato,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text that the Emperor had commanded him to guard the passes of the <hi>Po,</hi> and the Estates of the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy:</hi> but in effect it was that <hi>Collato</hi> was very glad, to see the Glory which <hi>Spinola</hi> had formerly acquired to be diminished. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was also extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily provoked against that General, because he would not joyn his Army to his for the defence of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> which the Duke wished for rather than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging <hi>Casal. Victor Amedeus</hi> had also obtained from <hi>Spain</hi> a Prohibition to him to make any Peace, and he was to expect a new power from <hi>Madrid,</hi> to conclude the Truce.</p>
               <p>This General grew Melancholly, and gave not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before <hi>Casal</hi> with the same Calmness as before, and the French said themselves, that the Orders he gave for the manner of attacking this place were very bad. So being weary of the Siege, and provoked with the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Spaniards gave him, he abandoned the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affairs and fell sick of Grief. The four French Generals <hi>Schomberg, de la Force, Montmorency,</hi> and <hi>D'Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiat,</hi> were on their side induced to the Truce, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great number of Soldiers which deserted, or
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:187699:176"/> which were sick in the Army, the small number of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry they had, and the extremity they knew <hi>Casal</hi> was in, which they gave over for almost lost. Besides they agreed not amongst themselves, the Mareschal <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> commanded an Army in part, and <hi>de la Force,</hi> and <hi>Montmorency,</hi> because that <hi>d'Effiat</hi> a Creature of the Cardinals, only knew the secret, and had power to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate.</p>
               <p>The Treaty of Truce being carried to <hi>Casal,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> second Son of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Thoiras</hi> also, made their particular Treaties, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the execution of the Truce, and the Surrender of the Town and Castle of <hi>Casal,</hi> it was the Marquis of <hi>St. Croix</hi> which treated with them, by reason of the sickness of <hi>Spinola,</hi> who had remitted the conduct of the Army to him. But <hi>St. Croix</hi> had with so little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness guarded the Avenues of the Citadel, that the Garison which at the conclusion of the Truce, was fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of Sicknesses when the Truce came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, was more numerous, and free from inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which might put them out of a condition to make a vigorous resistance. The Magazines which were void were also filled, by the little faithfulness of the Spanish Soldiers, who sold Victuals to the French, as much as they pleased, and to enable them to buy. <hi>Thoiras</hi> had several ways been furnished with Money: and <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> himself, who ought to have been Neuter in this Affair, brought with him when he Negotiated the Truce some thousands of Pistols, a service which afterwards, gained him the good will of <hi>France,</hi> and above all the esteem and friendship of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola,</hi> for some reasons which he might tell <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> would never sign the Truce, and died in a few days, after making great complaints of the Count, Duke, and Council of <hi>Spain;</hi> who, after they had tried his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity during thirty two years, were come to doubt of it, and seeming to put more confidence in the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> than in him. This fault of the <hi>Conde d'Olivarez,</hi> was the cause that <hi>Casal</hi> remained to the French, as you will find in the sequel. But it must be confessed, that after the Cardinal had made so much noise about it he
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:187699:176"/> had done no great matter for its preservation, and that if the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was not by the prudence of this Minister.</p>
               <p>A short time after, <note n="*" place="margin">13 <hi>Octob. Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 230.</note>
                  <hi>Leon Brulart,</hi> assisted by Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> concluded a Treaty at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of the Emperor; where after the regulation of what the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> should give to the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Succession of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The Emperor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him the investiture of his Estates, provided he asked it with submission. This Treaty contained di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other particular Articles, and the method of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting them, which I will pass over. But few People could persuade themselves, that so old a Minister as <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lart,</hi> would have made such a fault, and especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assisted by Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> to whom the Cardinal had intrusted his most secret thoughts, and who was no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in matters of Negotiations. It was rather to be supposed, that the Cardinal had altered his Sentiments, according as the state of Affairs changed, and that he sometimes desired Peace, and sometimes War; as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it most agreeable to the present Interest of <hi>France,</hi> or as he judged it might render his Ministry most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Crown.</p>
               <p>I cannot dwell on the circumstances of this Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it is good to report the Sentiments which <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lert</hi> had conceived of Father <hi>Joseph,</hi> in the transacting of this affair <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 259</note> when he was returned from his Embassy, he said to several of his Friends, that this Capuchin had nothing of his Order but the Habit, nor had nothing of a Christian but the name; that he was a Spirit full of Artifices and Cheats; that he endeavoured to Cheat all the World; that during the Negotiation at <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> he had never made him partaker of his Councils, nor communicated any thing to him till after it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; that he had an oblique Soul, which had nothing in prospect, but how to increase his Esteem with the Cardinal. He assured, that that Prelate had made no great noise against him, as if he had passed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, only the better to cover the orders he had given him. One day the Cardinal invited him to a treat which he made to divers Persons, when they
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:187699:177"/> brought in the Cards after Dinner, he set himself to play with the Cardinal at <hi>Prime.</hi> It happen'd there was a difference between them about certain Cards, of which the Company were agreed to be judges, who having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in favour of the Cardinal for fear of offending him, <hi>Brulart</hi> took up all the Money which was before him, and paid the Cardinal thirteen hundred Pistols, which he had won of him, but he could not forbear saying, that there were Pirates at Land as well as a Sea. Afterwards as he departed the Cardinal followed him softly, and having taken him by the Neck, said, that <hi>Brulart</hi> was a handsom Man, and it would do him a mischief to take his Head from his Shoulders, as he had run the hazard.</p>
               <p>In the time of the Conclusion of the Peace at <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> the French Generals thought to relieve the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Casal,</hi> which could not escape from the Marquis of <hi>St. Croix,</hi> Successor of <hi>Spinola,</hi> if not suddenly done. The Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>D'Effiat</hi> were returned into <hi>France,</hi> but the Mareschal <hi>de Maril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> was come in their place, to joyn himself to <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> and <hi>de la Force.</hi> Although it was a business of great difficulty to march five and twenty or thirty Leagues into an Enemies Country, and to gather together as much Victuals as might maintain the Army going and comming back, and to put into <hi>Casal;</hi> they resolved to venture all that might happen, because the King had sent express orders to endeavour the succour of <hi>Thoiras.</hi> Wherefore they prepared to march by the 13th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> maugre all the Negotiations of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got nothing to induce the differing parties to a Peace; there were come from <hi>France</hi> new Forces and Money, and the 13th of <hi>October</hi> the Mareschals of <hi>France</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Artillery towards the plain of <hi>Scarnafit,</hi> and all the Army followed with Bread and Bisket for 12 days, besides some Meat, with design to hazard all to disengage the Citadel.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 26. 20 <hi>Octob.</hi>
                  </note> the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> was brought to the Generals, which broke all their measures, because it was agreed by that Treaty that all hostility should cease between the two Armies, as soon as the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:187699:177"/> Generals had received it. The Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> who had the greatest authority in the Army, was of opinion, that this Treaty was not to be accepted of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was not to receive Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into his Estate till after six Weeks, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Troops only fifteen days after, which obliged the French to remain still two Months in <hi>Italy,</hi> and there to continue the Campagne, that is to say, to run the hazard of perishing there, either by famine or sickness, without considering Desertions, which are always great when an Army suffers too much. The same day this Treaty came to his hands, he told <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and the Envoys of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> who were with him, that he refused not to execute the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> but that he required that the City and Castle of <hi>Casal,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being put into the hands of the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> in fifteen days as the Treaty directed, should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be done, because it was not sure for the French, that if their Army should retreat, to trust to the good faith of the Spaniards, who afterwards would do what they pleased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mazarine</hi> went to make this Proposal to the Generals of the Emperor and of <hi>Spain;</hi> and after he had treated with the Marquisses of <hi>St. Croix</hi> and <hi>Collalto,</hi> he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the French Camp, which was at <hi>la Roche,</hi> and told the Generals that the Spaniards consented, that they should furnish the Citadel of <hi>Casal</hi> with Men and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a year, to let them know that they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther design than to execute the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbonne.</hi> The French took this offer for an assured mark that the Spaniards were afraid of them, and in this thought, they believed they might obtain any thing more, if they made their constancy to appear: They therefore reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this offer, whatsoever <hi>Mazarine</hi> could say, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack the Lines of the Spaniards. These last had twenty five thousand foot, and six or seven thousand Horse; the French equalled them in the number of Infantry, but were inferior in Cavalry. Nothwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Mareschals of <hi>France</hi> resolved to attack their Lines, which indeed were not alike finished throughout, but were strong enough to give the advantage to the Spanish Army, had it been well commanded. But the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:187699:178"/> Marquis of <hi>St. Croix</hi> was not at all a General of an Army, nor had he scarcely any Officers capable by their ability to assist him: On the contrary the three Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals were very skilful Men, they had most brave sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterne Officers which are never wanting in the Armies of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 26th, the French Army appeared, and that of the Spaniards, which was Ranged in battle within the Lines, sent out some Musqueteers to molest the French on their march, by the favour of a flood, after which they were to pass. In the interim, <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken infinite pains to come and go Post sometimes from one side, and then from the other, to endeavour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate this Affair, pressed with very great constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Spaniards to grant the French their demands, and endeavoured to hinder the French from coming to blows so soon as they intended. He passed many times from one Camp to the other, and run the hazard of Life (by not being at a distance) by some Soldiers who fired at him. In fine, by representing to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards the Resolution of the French, and magnifying their Forces, he obtained what they had just before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused. As soon as the Marquis <hi>de St. Croix</hi> had passed his word, he mounted on a good Horse, which <hi>Picolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> lent him, and run with full speed to the French Generals, who marched every one in the head of the body which they led in a profound silence, and which were already within Cannon-shot, which begun to play from the Spanish side. <hi>Mazarine</hi> afar off made a sign with his Hat on high for them to halt, and then went to speak to the Mareschal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who had the secret of the intentions of the King and the Cardinal. The Army made an halt, and the three Mareschals being assembled together, accepted the terms which <hi>Mazarine</hi> offered them, and this last presently hasted to carry the News to the Spaniards, who thereupon forbid firing on the French. In the interim, two shots of Cannon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been made without order, it was very near, that the French Army had fallen on in spight of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. <hi>Mazarine</hi> returning to excuse the matter; the Marquis of <hi>St. Croix, Philip de Spinola,</hi> General of the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:187699:178"/> Artillery, the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> Master of the Camp, General of the Infantry, and other Officers to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Forty went out of the Lines: as on the French side the three Mareschals advanced with the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Officers. When they came near to each other, <hi>Mazarine</hi> made them a short discourse, wherein he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them for having chosen rather to end their differences by a Treaty then by a Battel, and exhorted them to embrace each other, which being done, he repeated with a loud Voice the following Articles.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That the Spaniards on the morrow, being the 27th of</hi> October, <hi>should go out of the Town and Castle of</hi> Casal, <hi>as also out of the places of</hi> Pendesture, de Rossignano, Nizzo de la Paille, <hi>and of</hi> Castle-Ponzone; <hi>and that at the same time the French should depart the Citadel of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, <hi>it remaining free to the Duke</hi> de Mayenne <hi>to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all these places such Governors and Garisons as he pleased.</hi>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>That the Governors which the Duke of</hi> Mayenne <hi>should send to the other Places, should be presented to this Commissary, who should dispatch their Patents without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Oath of them.</hi>

               <p n="4">IV. <hi>That the</hi> 23 <hi>of</hi> November, <hi>the Investiture being agreed or refused to the Duke of</hi> Mantua, <hi>this Commissary should go out of</hi> Casal <hi>and</hi> Montferrat.</p>

               <p> This Treaty being Signed on both sides, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards begun in good faith to Execute it, and the French Generals searched on every side for Victuals and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition to put into <hi>Casal,</hi> before they followed their Army, which was to march presently away; but they could not find as much as was necessary to resist the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, in case they should come to attack the Place in the Winter; they therefore sought for pretensions, not to be obliged punctually to observe the Treaty. They began to complain▪ that the Spaniards had made many infractions, and caused three Regiments of their Army to return to <hi>Casal,</hi> out of which they drove not only those which were not yet departed, but also the Imperial Commissary. The Spanish Generals being advertised of this, and of the security with which the French other Troops retreated, concluding they had no more to fear, crossed the way to Charge the French, who infallibly had been cut to pieces, if <hi>Mazarine</hi> had not given them notice of the march of the Spaniards.

Rec.</hi> T. 7. p. 278.</note> that the French should go out of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Spaniards should permit Provisions to be brought out of <hi>Piedmont</hi> to revictual <hi>Casal,</hi> that the Complaints about Infractions should be remitted to the Pope, which as they said had been made on both sides. The Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were in <hi>Casal</hi> before the 30th of <hi>November;</hi> the French assembled to retire themselves, but they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a new Infidelity, in that the Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> dismissed a Regiment of <hi>Switzers</hi> which was in the King's Service, to the intent that the Duke might entertain one part of them, The Spaniards made a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry upon this, and to appease them they put out the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and took in <hi>Montferrins</hi> in their places.</p>
               <p>Every thing was quiet, the Mareschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> would not leave in <hi>Piedmont</hi> but ten thousand Foot and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Corners of Horse. The three Mareschals thought of nothing but repassing the Mountains, and the care of Commanding the Troops which remained in <hi>Italy,</hi> was left to <hi>Thoiras,</hi> * whom the King made Mareschal of <note place="margin">19 <hi>Decem.</hi>

                  <hi>France,</hi> as also the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>D'Effiat,</hi> though some little time after the other.</p>
               <p>Thus finished the Campaign of the year 1630. in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Spaniard found himself devested of what he had taken in <hi>Italy,</hi> and by which he had been at vast Charges, without any advantage remaining by it. But as the Spaniards, could not make use either of time or opportunity to make themselves Masters, so is it certain, that the Cardinal had more reason to boast of his own happiness by their ill Conduct, than to brag of the good Success, which the Arms of <hi>France</hi> had, since Persons of an indifferent Capacity, might many times have taken <hi>Casal,</hi> with the Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the French had thrown numbers into it.</p>
               <p>But to return to what passed in <hi>France</hi> during these things which I have recounted of the affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> The King having subjugated all <hi>Savoy,</hi> except the Fort of <hi>Montmeillan,</hi> thought of nothing more than returning into <hi>France. Savoy</hi> no way agreeing with him, he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no divertisement there, he departed therefore from <hi>St. John de Maurienne</hi> at the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> and took the way of <hi>Lyons,</hi> where he arrived the seventh of the Month, without any inconvenience, though he had passed through places infected with the Plague; but he fell sick at <hi>Lyons</hi> about the end of <hi>September,</hi> of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume in the <hi>Mesentery,</hi> which made his Belly swell, and the Physitians not knowing the cause of his Malady, gave him for lost without retrieve: But this Impostume was broken, and the matter having run out in Stools the King soon recovered his Health, contrary to the opinion of the all the World.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was Sick <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Simon,</hi> Grand Esquire, who stirred not from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King, to incline his Majesty to take some care of his Prime Minister▪ The Grand Esquire ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spoke to the King, found him perfectly well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and suggested to him the thought of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Cardinal to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who being Governor of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> might easily save the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, by conducting him into his Government. The King approved of the Expedient, and <hi>St. Simon</hi> having informed the Cardinal of what had passed, that Prelate came to the King's Bed-side, who told him he was careful of his security. The Cardinal all in tears, and feigning to ail nothing, answered, That he should not be sorry to die, after he experimented so good a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. In the mean time, the Grand Esquire having on behalf of the King spoken to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> he took upon him with pleasure the Charge committed to him, and engaged to conduct the Cardinal to <hi>Brouage,</hi> with faithful Troops of which he named all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. The King in the sequel made <hi>Montmorency</hi> come into his Chamber, and recommended the Cardinal to him with weeping, and in terms very affectionate. The Duke promised the King to bring him in all safety to <hi>Brouage,</hi> and to protect him against all. It is said, the * Cardinal prayed the Mareschal <hi>de Bassompiere</hi> to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Preface of the Mem. of</hi> Bassomp.</note> assure the Switzers to him, in case the King should die; and that the Mareschal refused it, saying nevertheless, that the Marquis <hi>d' Alincourt,</hi> Governor of <hi>Lyons,</hi> might contribute much to his safety; and that he might be disposed thereunto by the Marquis of <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> his Cousin-German, and the Cardinal's Creature. This and the Devotion which <hi>Bassompiere</hi> had for the Princess of <hi>Conti,</hi> Enemy to the Cardinal, render'd the Mareschal suspected, and liable to the cruel Revenge of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal afterwards. The King being recovered, as I have said, quitted <hi>Lyons,</hi> and was followed by the Queen-Mother and the Cardinal, who Embarked themselves on the <hi>Loire,</hi> and came to <hi>Roanne</hi> in the same Boat, and to the Eyes of the Court appeared entirely reconciled. But the Cardinal, who knew what was passed, and to whom
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:187699:180"/> the King told whatsoever he heard, had care not to trust it; and if the Queen-Mother endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him in the mind of the King, he studied no less to provoke her Son against her; He persuaded <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> T. 7. p. 265.</note> this jealous and fearful Prince, that this Princess loved the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> better than him; and that she consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Astrologers to know when this latter should mount the Throne, because having no Dauphin, the Crown belonged to him. This was not altogether false, and the King being convinced of it, believed that all the Queen did tended that way, and nothing could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade him to the contrary. All that the Queens could say against the Cardinal had no effects upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not only difficult, but also incredible, that this Prelate should enterprize any thing whatsoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, when it was easie for the Queen-Mother and Monsieur to do so; and it was to be believed that they had a mind to it, by the disturbances they had lately made.</p>
               <p>The Court being arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> the King went to <hi>St. Germains</hi> and to <hi>Versailles,</hi> and the Queen-Mother to her Palace at <hi>Luxemberg,</hi> and there it was that her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Cardinal began to break forth, although the King did all he could to make them agree, and came himself to the Palace of Ambassadors to be near the Queen-Mother, and converse often with her.</p>
               <p>In fine, he drew this promise from her, that she should live quietly with him; and to compleat the Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they agreed that the King should on the Eleventh of <hi>November</hi> at Eleven of the Clock before Noon, bring the Cardinal and his Niece <hi>de Combalet,</hi> into the Queens Chamber, to the end that she might show them that she had no further hatred against them. The Queen would have the Niece come first into her Presence, and as she cast her self at her feet, to render her thanks for the great favour she had done her; the Queen instead of pardoning her, fell upon her with most injurious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, before the King, and <hi>Combalet</hi> returned with wet Eyes, for the affront that she had received. The King said all that could come into his mind, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:187699:181"/> to appease his Mother, whose transports of Choler made him, as he said, suffer extreamly. But hoping that having discharged her Choler, she would use the Cardinal better, he told her, that he would fetch him in.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal, who was in an adjacent Chamber, knew by the Countenance of his Niece, whom he saw passing by, that without doubt she had been ill treated, and he was absolutely confirmed in his suspicion, when he entred the Queen's Cabinet, who had Choler paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her Visage. When he came a little nearer to her she called him Cheat, Ingrate, Malicious, the most Wicked Man in the Kingdom, and Disturber of the Publick Quiet, and turning her self to the King, she told him he beheld a Man, that would take the Crown from him to give it to the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> (with whom he had been long reconciled) and make him marry <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balet.</hi> The King replied hereupon, and answered, that the Cardinal was a good and honest Man, who served him faithfully, and with whom he was well satisfied; That the Queen disobliged him, put him to torture, and that he could not remit the extream displeasure she had done him. He added all he could to sweeten her, but the Queen was inflamed more and more; the King bad the Cardinal to go, and this Prelate withdrew, in a great fear that the King's Authority would not prevail, and that he should be obliged to leave the Court. The King staid some time with his Mother, and told her he was amazed at this violent manner of procedure, and that she should give her self over so much to her passion. The Queen was not for all this appeased, but drove from her service <hi>Combalet,</hi> who was her Lady of the turn, and the Marquis of <hi>Meillezaye,</hi> who was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of her Guards, because they were of the Cardinal's Kindred.</p>
               <p>In fine, the King out of measure provoked, that his Mother had forfeited her word and her respect, as he believed, went out of her Cabinet, saying, that he had had too much patience. He after demanded of <hi>St. Simon,</hi> what he could say of what he had lately heard,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:187699:181"/> for he was present; and this favourite answered, that he seemed he was in the other World, but at last the King was Master, <hi>Yes I am,</hi> replied the King, <hi>and will make the World to know it.</hi> In effect, he dealt with her more like a Master than a Son; and he was told, that the obligations which he had for the Cardinal were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more considerable, than the natural Duty of Children, towards those who had brought them into the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Simon</hi> let the Cardinal know that his Affairs went very well, and went with the King to the Ambassador's Place, where this Prince shut himself up with him, with forbiddance of Entry to any Person whatsoever. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unbuttoned his Gesticore, he threw himself upon the Bed, and said to <hi>Simon</hi> that he felt himself inflamed all over, that the Queen by her sensless obstinacy, and by the injurious manner with which she had treated <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balet</hi> and the Cardinal in his presence, and contrary to the Parole she had given him, had so far discomposed him that he could find no rest, nor comfort for his grief: That she would have him turn off a Minister, who was to him of the greatest usefulness, and of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary capacity, to put others in his place, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and incapable to serve the Crown: That when she had received Evil Impressions, she was no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to hear reason. In the sequel, he demanded of <hi>St. Simon,</hi> what he thought he ought to do on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and <hi>St. Simon</hi> answered, That it behoved his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty for his proper Interest to protect the Cardinal against the Cabal of those who envied the post which he held, and that he should banish from the Queen-Mother those People who filled her head with Ill Impressions, and which opposed the good designs of the premier Minister; At last the King resolved to go suddenly to <hi>Versailles,</hi> and to cause the Cardinal to come thither to take with him such measures, as he should observe in this affair.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, this Prelate was returned home, for to put up presently all his Writings and his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Moveables to retire himself to <hi>Brouage,</hi> of which he was Governor, as we said before. The Cardinal <hi>de la</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:187699:182"/>
                  <hi>Valette,</hi> who was come to Visit him, did all he could to oblige him to stay, and to give time for Repentance, and hinder'd him from a sudden departure. Whilst they were together, the Gentleman which <hi>St. Simon</hi> had sent to him, to tell him that things went well, desired to speak with him; and having told him the news he had orders to bring to his Eminence, he determined to stay; a while after he received a second advice like to the first. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Valette</hi> being gone to the King, learned the same thing from <hi>St. Simon,</hi> and having spoke to the King, that Prince said to him, <hi>Monsieur the Cardinal hath a good Master, go tell him I recommend me to him, and let him without delay come to</hi> Versailles.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Queen-Mother who believed that the King went to dismiss the Cardinal, out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance to her, thought of nothing but the authority she was about to enjoy, and believed already to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all the benefits which the Cardinal had been Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of for some Years. All the world went to make their Court to her, and instead of following the King to <hi>Versailles,</hi> to hinder him from taking resolutions which might be disadvantageous to her; she amused her self with receiving of applauses for a thing which was no way done. The King was presently advertised of the great concourse of People, which frequented <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> to wish happiness to the Queen, for that she had ruined the Cardinal, which encreased the suspicions which many had endeavoured to put into his mind, and which he a long time entertained, that the Queen-Mother sought only to Govern. In this conjuncture, <hi>St. Simon</hi> advertised the Mareschals <hi>de Crequi</hi> and <hi>de Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piere,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Montmorency</hi> not to fall into the snare, as the other Courtiers did, who believed the Cardinal lost: and afterwards they called that day <hi>the day of Sots,</hi> because the Enemies of the Cardinal were taken for Sots.</p>
               <p>The King being arrived at <hi>Versailles,</hi> the Cardinal with all speed repaired thither, that he might throw himself at the feet of the King, and render him thanks, <hi>as the best, the most constant, and most obliging Master</hi>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:187699:182"/>
                  <hi>that ever the Sun shined upon.</hi> The King answered him, That he had in him a very good Servant, of a Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so great, and so extraordinary Fidelity, that he thought himself obliged to protect him, so much the more because it was a demonstration of the respect and acknowledgment he ought to have for the Queen his Mother, if he had behaved himself otherwise he had abandoned him; That he would protect him against all those who had made a Cabal to destroy him, in abusing the goodness of the Queen his Mother, that he required him to continue to serve him, and he would maintain him against all who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired his ruine. The Cardinal, who wept when he pleased, with his Eyes full of Tears, cast himself a-new at the King's Feet, and began to say, <hi>That he could not accept of the honour of remaining near his Majesty, for fear of being the occasion of a scandalous division between the Son and the Mother, and that he would seek for some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude where to hide himself and lament the rest of his days, the misfortune he had to be defamed as an ingrateful Person to his Benefactress.</hi> After he had said this, he kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King's feet and arose. The King commanded him absolutely to continue in his Service, as formerly, for such was his Will; the Cardinal still declined it for the same reason; and the King told him, that it was not the Queen, but such and such, which he named, who had made all this disturbance, whom he should remember, and should take heed of them. He added again, That he would protect him against all; that he would be obeyed, and that the world should know the truth of these confusions.</p>
               <p>After the King having caused all to depart who were present, except <hi>St. Simon</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> he caused <hi>Bullion</hi> and <hi>Bouthillier</hi> to be called, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give the Seals immediately to <hi>Chasteauneuf.</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had been given to <hi>Marillac,</hi> who had them, to come to <hi>Glatigny</hi> near <hi>Versailles,</hi> and he believed it was a sign which the King gave of his confidence in him, until on the morrow he saw <hi>la Ville aux Clers</hi> on the King's part demand the Seals, and himself led to Prison to <hi>Chasteau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun.</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:187699:183"/> Soon after, it was known at <hi>Paris</hi> what had been done at <hi>Versailles,</hi> and the Queen-Mother, who the day before saw her self surrounded with Courtiers found her self on the morrow alone at her Palace of <hi>Luxemburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal was perfectly confirmed against all fear, which he had of losing the King's favour, and now thought of nothing but destroying those who had machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated his ruine. The two Brothers <hi>de Marillac</hi> were the chief, and the Keeper of the Seals was already in Prison; there remained only the Mareschal who was in <hi>Italy:</hi> A Courier was dispatched to the Mareschal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> to Arrest him, and send him Prisoner into <hi>France,</hi> which was done the same day as the Courier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>The greatest Enemies <note n="*" place="margin">12 <hi>Nov.</hi>
                  </note> which the Cardinal had next to the Queen, were the Princess of <hi>Conti</hi> and the <note place="margin">* <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 293.</note> Dutchesses <hi>d'Ornano</hi> and <hi>d'Elbeuf.</hi> They were perfectly well united in the hatred which they had against him, and in the care they took to render him odious to the Queen-Mother. There was always one at least of them with that Princess; so that they lost no occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate her against the Minister, and easily hinder'd him from a Reconciliation with his first Benefactress. The Dutchess <hi>d'Elbeuf</hi> was provoked against him, because of the long Persecution, which he had caused to the House of <hi>Vendosm,</hi> and the other two because of the wrong he did to the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> from whom he took the charge of Admiral of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which he had by virtue of his being Governor of <hi>Provence.</hi> The Cardinal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that it belonged of right to him, as Grand Master of the Navigation and Commerce of <hi>France;</hi> and the Duke offered to change it for any other thing, or to make a present to him of it: but he would not make a cession of it to him, because it belonged to him of right.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother, after the noise she had made on St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Day, would not only have the Cardinal to meddle no more in her Private Affairs, but she refused to see him at Council. In the mean time, being pressed by Cardinal <hi>Bagni,</hi> she consented to see him in the first Council which was held, provided it were at the Queen
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:187699:183"/> Regent's. She also would have that the two Brothers <hi>de Marillac</hi> should be set at Liberty, and the King should promise her, not to allow Monsieur, without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to espouse the Princess of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and that neither her Servants, nor the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s should be any way disturbed. Nevertheless, being * pressed extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, she consented at last to see the Cardinal at her <note place="margin">23. <hi>of the same month</hi>
                  </note> Palace, in presence of the King, of Cardinal <hi>Bagni,</hi> and of Father <hi>Suffren,</hi> but she received him with very great coldness.</p>
               <p>Three days after <note n="*" place="margin">26 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi>
                  </note> which was St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Day, on which the custom is to exhort Enemies to Reconciliation, the Queen-Mother sent for the Cardinal by Father <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fren.</hi> He went to see her; as soon as that Princess be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him she fell a weeping, and he did the same; she ordered him to sit down, but he refused, saying, That Honour did not belong to a Person in Disgrace; the Queen, speaking about what had passed, said, that it was never her intention that he should be deprived of the Ministry; and the Cardinal, who then acted the humble, replied, that nevertheless she had said, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she or he must leave the Court. But Father <hi>Suffren</hi> said, that it was only a movement of anger; and the Cardinal went on, saying, <q>That he would Die ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than do any thing which might be to the prejudice of her Majesty, but he was much troubled, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned, without being convicted; and if through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world that Regard was to be had, much more ought they to convince a person who without Vanity might glorify himself, to have successfully served the State on the most Important occasions: That he was ready to justifie himself, and if it were found that he had been guilty of any disrespect for her, he desired no favour; but if his Innocence appeared, she might do him the honour of acknowledging it. That though he passionately desired to return into her favour, he durst be bold to tell her, that having served her four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, he knew her humour too well, as to hope for it: Notwithstanding, he would never leave off to demonstrate the passion which he had to serve her.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:187699:184"/>
               <p> The Queen said, that he had not favoured her at all, in the business of Monsieur, and the Cardinal protested, that he had defended her to the King as much as was possible. In fine, the Queen told him after many other things, that she would carry her towards him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as she found he demeaned himself towards her. The Cardinal answered as with respect; <q>That there was no proportion between Servants and Masters, and, as for his part, he would never be wanting in his duty to her, and would forget nothing which might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to her satisfaction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the Q. Mother was two or three times at the Council with the Cardinal, but knowing his revengeful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as she knew the same in her self, she left off coming thither, and refus'd absolutely to see him, for fear of disgust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those who had declared for her against the Minister.</p>
               <p>Monsieur, * who since his return seemed reconciled to <note place="margin">Siri as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> him at the request of the Queen-Mother, who dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled still, would no more see him. But he visited him by the King's Order, and by consent of the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who hoped by dissembling still, he might better as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist her to destroy that Minister. In the mean time, <hi>Puy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurens</hi> and <hi>Coigneux</hi> believed they might find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do their business by offering their Services to the Court. The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> obtained from the King a charge of President of the Parliament for <hi>le Coig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux,</hi> that he recommended him to the Cardinal, and made him labour for him at the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of 50000 Crowns was made to <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> and he was promised the title of a Duke in case he would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Dutchess, or purchase an Estate which had the title of a Dutchy. The Marquis of <hi>Rambouillet</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this affair with the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> had 100000 Livres. On the other side, the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> by their persuasion, promised to depend entirely on the King, and to let him see by his actions, that he would no way give ear to Counsels contrary to his Service. He further passed his word to protect the Cardinal on all occasions, even with the Queen-Mother. <hi>Le Coigneux</hi> and <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> promised also to behave themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> so as the King should see
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:187699:184"/> the effects of the Promises which his Brother had made to him, and should forget nothing that might induce the Queen to be reconciled with the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>The Duke's Servants seemed for some Weeks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1631"/> satisfied with the Court; although the Queen-Mother was extreamly vexed to see her self deserted by her Son, in a time when she had most need of them. But they imagining that there would more be granted them if they desired it, and if Monsieur, who did nothing but what they prompted him to, would show still some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle discontent. Wherefore they obliged him to re-enter into the Party of the Queen-Mother: <hi>Puylaurens</hi> made new demands, and <hi>Le Coigneux</hi> would have a Cardinal's Cap, without staying till the Pope advanced more to that dignity. The King had no design to satisfie him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a Person of an ill Life; but <hi>Coigneux</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it the more importunately, because <hi>Puylaurens</hi> was bargaining with the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the Lands of <hi>Danville</hi> which had the title of a Dutchy. As this affair was ready to be concluded <hi>le Coigneux</hi> fell into an extraordinary Melancholly, and that he might not fall into despair, the Ministers decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as much as they could, the conclusion of the Sale of the Land of <hi>Danville. Puylaurens</hi> coming to the knowledge of it, believed they designed to mock him, so he combined with <hi>le Coigneux</hi> a new, and with him formed a design to carry the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> from the Court; thinking that way both the more easily to obtain their demands: This Prince agreed with the Queen-Mother; that she in the mean time should stay at Court, to support his party, and that he would go and Cabal in some Province; she bestowed on him Jewels of great price, which she had from her Husband, and which she had in her keeping.</p>
               <p>With this Resolution, he went <note n="*" place="margin">3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> January.</note> to see the Cardinal in his Palace at <hi>Paris,</hi> and told him, that he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded his Eminence would serve him on his occasions; but having seen that he did not keep his promise he came to retract that which he had given of protecting him. The ardinal asked in what he had not been as good as his word? The Duke replied, That he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:187699:185"/> in favour of the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and that they designed, that he should absolutely forsake the interests of the Queen-Mother. He added, that he would retire to his own home; and that if they pressed upon him, he would defend himself. Mounting his Coach he went directly for <hi>Orleans,</hi> whilst the Cardinal went to give the King an account of what had passed.</p>
               <p>The retreat of the Duke seemed strange to every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, because he had been no way ill treated at the Court, and the King seemed against the Queen-Mother's will to have consented to his retreat, although she denied it. The Cardinal used to say, that he had three Masters, the King, the Queen-Mother, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and that he would serve them all, but every in his rank, it being no way just that the last should go before the first. He protested always that he was disposed to render all sorts of services to the Queen, and that, as People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the Misunderstanding in which she lived with him, was the cause of the Evil Conduct of Monsieur: The King undertook to reconcile them, and so far pressed the Queen-Mother that she seemed to be disposed to it. She made the Mareschal of <hi>Schomberg</hi> be told it by her first Physitian, but she showed she would not take into her Service those whom she had once turned away, to which the Cardinal easily consented.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, he advised the King to go into <hi>Compeigne,</hi> and endeavour to draw his Mother thither, because <hi>Paris</hi> was not a place proper to reduce her by Authority, to what he desired of her. This Princess was very well beloved there, and the Cardinal extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated, so that it was not for him to contest with her in that City. The Queen, who knew nothing of the Cardinal's design to Arrest her, and who would not stay long without the sight of the King, <note n="*" place="margin">17th Feb.</note> followed him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Compeigne,</hi> the Court being there; the Mareschal <hi>Scomberg</hi> told <hi>Vautier,</hi> that the King desired nothing so much as to live with his Mother as formerly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was necessary that she should reconcile her self with the Cardinal, and assist at the Council, as she was accustomed before these disturbances. It was also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that she should give the King a promise in writing,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:187699:185"/> by which she should engage her self to enterprize no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing against the quiet of the State, and never to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect any of those whom the King should judge culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any thing contrary to his Service; excepting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Domesticks of that Princess. She seemed to be ready to do all they required of her, only she would not come to the Council with the Cardinal, nor give the Writing which was demanded. The King sent the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>Schomberg</hi> and <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> to make her the same offers which had been made to <hi>Vautier;</hi> but she would not come thither, say what they would.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the King called a Cabinet Council, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what he should do in this conjuncture. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who knew nothing would be done there but what he desired, and who perhaps had suggested to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, who all depended on him, feigned presently, with a Modesty which he affected when it was his turn, not to be able to tell his mind, because it was about an affair in which he was Personally concerned. But the King having commanded him absolutely to tell his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; he said, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 302.</note>
                  <q>That the Emperor, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> not being friends to <hi>France,</hi> they had no other designs than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb their happiness either by Wars or secret Intrigues, by which it appeared that both the Queens were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied, as well as the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> with whom they were united in their discontentments. That the Parliaments, the Grandees, and the People, did earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to draw advantages from the dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Royal Authority. That the Cabals of the Court, of the Women, and of the English, in a few years past put all <hi>France</hi> into a Flame; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Faction was far more strong, because the quality of the Women was more considerable, and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber greater. That <hi>Spain</hi> was in a better condition to act, and <hi>England</hi> concerned it self, since there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proofs that she had sent Money to the Discontents. That the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> was of the Cabal, since he had done all that possibly he could, to hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of the Treaty at <hi>Ratisbonne.</hi> That the House of <hi>Guise</hi> and the Parliaments worked both on the same
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:187699:186"/> Foundation, and endeavoured to excite the People to new Commotions. That <hi>Biscaros,</hi> who had espoused a Niece of the <hi>Marillac</hi>'s and was Governor of <hi>Verdun,</hi> had refused to put it into the King's hands▪ hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to obtain the Deliverance of the Mareschal. That all this had come to pass because the Queen-Mother was discontented, and made a Cabal at the Court.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal added, <q>That whilst Strangers could Embroil the Court, and may see the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> distanced from it, until he can find an opportunity to do his business, they would easily traverse all the designs of the Crown, and maintain the Cabals which they made in the Kingdom: So that Peace with Strangers was impossible, and that no concord could be found within, because the War fomented the Discords. That there was none but the King who could remedy this and chuse him who should be most proper to cure the Evil. That it was certain that the Queen-Mother minded nothing else but to destroy him, (him the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) and she would never be cured of that Passion: That as much as the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> beleived the Queen-Mother was in a state to bring things to pass, he would remain united to her. That whilst the affair within were in this disposition, it was impossible to bring those without to an end; nor to provide for the necessities of the State. That new Discontents were made every day, and those who were most Interested for the Service of the King, made excessive Pretensions. That by dissembling, the evil would at last become so great, that it would be incurable. That on the least sickness of the King, the Malecontents might make themselves Masters of the Person of the King and of the State, without the better and most Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the King finding any recompence, nor provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for their safety, because every where People adore the Rising Sun. That the same thing might happen on the first evil success, which the King's designs may have since they will not fail to impute it to those, who have used their utmost endeavours to divert them. That in such a Rencounter, the Servants of the King would remain at the mercy of the Women, whose
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:187699:186"/> choser is implacable. That <hi>Coigneux</hi> was a man could keep no moderation, nor would believe himself secure, whilst any who were of the Interest of the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister were alive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Artificious Minister, after he had frighted the King in this manner, continued, saying, <q>That if on the contrary, endeavours were readily to be made to remedy these brouilleries of the Court, by Wars which should appear most safe for his Majesty, they must presently hinder that the ill will of the Malecontents, may have no effect; and that in time they might be brought to reason. That weak Remedies do but irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate great Maladies, but violent ones do either cure them or take them quite away; and where touching will not do the Iron and Fire is to be applied. In the present juncture, we must either accommodate our selves with the Foreigners, by an honourable and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Peace, or be reconciled with the Queen-Mother, and with the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> drive away the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or take from the Queen those who suggest thoughts to her, contrary to the good of the State, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her to abstain a while comming to Court, lest by her presence she should entertain the Evil without thinking of it, since Monsieur being absent at a time, when she may be discontented at the Court; it would be almost impossible to bring these disturbances to a happy end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal having proposed these Expedients, as to give the King the choice of what he thought most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the purpose; pursued in the determination of what he most desired for the Reasons following. <q>That as to Peace with Foreigners, it was not to be hoped, during internal Divisions, of which they would take advantage; and besides this, it must be concluded and executed in an instant, and that could not be done without shamefully abandoning the Interests of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the State, which instead of being a Remedy must prove another Disease, not a solid Peace but the beginning of a new War. The accommodation with Monsieur, could no more be made, as to him, because those who were Masters over his spirit were insatiable,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:187699:187"/> and would never be content, unless they were absolute Masters. The Cardinal exaggerated their Evil conduct, and coming in the sequel to the Queen-Mother, he said, That it was no more possible to reconcile with her, Women being naturally Revengeful, and the Queen sufficiently dissembling, and came from a Country and House which rarely pardoned. That the Services which he (Cardinal) had done to the King and the State, would not hinder her from coming to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test extremities with him: That the intreaties of the King had been ineffectual; that she was not to be kept to Promises, that she had made them several times, to live well with the Minister, that she had kept those no better than what she might make for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That she would never be content until she had entirely ruined those she hated, and that he feared lest the effects of her Vengeance should go further, than she her self desired.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, there remained nothing more for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but to examine whether it would not be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the King, that he should withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that the King might live in peace with his Mother, his Spouse, and his Brother, who almost equally hated this Minister, or to remove the Queen-Mother, and those which fomented her discontents. He therefore said, <q>That if his withdrawing might be a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to cure the Maladies of the Court, he was to practice it without hesitation; and as for himself he desired it passionately. It was true, that in this there were many things to be considered, <hi>viz.</hi> If the spirits of the Malecontents would be satisfied with his retreat only, or if they would not destroy those who staid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and him who had retired, to render themselves Masters of the Royal Authority; if so, then this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ought not to be made use of, lest whilst endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to heal the sore complained of, a much worse should be produced.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He supposed that it was visible, that this Remedy would be worse than the Disease, and that it would be followed by all the mischiefs of which he had spoken. In effect, the humour in which the King was, which
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:187699:187"/> was incapable of fearing for himself, by the return of Queen-Mother, without any Minister daring to oppose her Passions. she would have Governed more absolutely than ever, and wholly given her self over to Vengeance, to prevent the designs of those who would not be pleased with her new Authority. <q>Therefore the Cardinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to dissipate the Cabals, which the Authority and discontent of the Queen entertained in the Court, in praying her to withdraw her self and to retire at some distance from <hi>Paris,</hi> and to drive away from her Evil Counsellors. He said nevertheless, That this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be put in execution with a great deal of sweetness, and in treating that Princess with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible respect. That exact measures were to be taken for to surmount all the obstacles, which Persons of great consideration might find in it, because to begin this affair, without coming to the end, would be to destroy all. That in truth, the Kingdom would find the Remedy violent, because few persons could know the great evils of the State, which would be cured by it. That whatsoever was done in this affair, would be attributed to the Premier Minister, but this Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency was to be despised, as the Chirurgion who cutteth off an Arm, never regards the loss of blood which happeneth. That if he had no regard but for himself, he would never have resolved to propose this Expedient, because all the world would believe that he acted for Vengeance, whilst he did nothing but what was for the good of the State, and that they would make a thousand Satyrs against him. That if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered his own Person, he had rather hazard perishing, without being defamed, than secure himself, by falling into the blame of all the Kingdom; but since the good of the State, and the conservation of the Authority and Person of the King required it to be so, he would sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render himself to what his Majesty and Council should find requisite.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He made this Speech full of Artifice, demanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the King to quit the Ministry in case his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty should embrace the latter Part; <q>Because the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal being dispersed, the other Ministers would be in a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:187699:188"/> condition to serve him as before, without dreading any thing. He added moreover, that the spirit of the Queen-Mother, would be so much the sooner cured, when she saw her self out of Power to do hurt, and that those who imbitter'd it were removed, she would seriously think of an accommodation with the Court. That the Foreigners, promising nothing to themselves by Domestick Discords, would in good earnest think of Peace for their proper Interest; That in a little time all the affairs of the King would be seen in their ordinary course, and come to an happy end: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, there would be very great hazard of doing well; and suppose they should go ill; he should be troubled for not having discharged his Conscience, by discovering the true cause. That Justice, in fine, was manifestly on the King's side, and he would have also the approbation of the People, when his design came to pass, which could not be expected, if he did not at once tear up the roots of all the Factions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All the Council applauded the Prime Minister, and assured the King, That no other Expedients but those were to be taken. There was but one thing in which they agreed not with the Cardinal, <hi>viz.</hi> his Retreat, which they looked upon, not as an innocent way, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the Spirits, but as a Remedy dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. As to the removal of the Queen-Mother, the Council would not tell their Sentiments, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to themselves the glory of Obeying his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, when he should determine concerning it.</p>
               <p>The King, without further Consultation, took the Party of removing the Queen-Mother, and he resolved to leave her at <hi>Compeigne</hi> under a good Guard: after he had offered her by Father <hi>Suffren,</hi> what she had already refused several times. She failed not to refuse it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, being still as much opiniastre as she was, and on the 23. of <hi>February</hi> the Court departed Early in the Morning without her knowledge. The King left the Mareschal <hi>d'Estrees</hi> at <hi>Compeigne,</hi> with Eight Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his Guards, fifty Men at Arms, and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Light-Horse, and gave him orders to keep Guards at the Gate of the Castle, and those of the Town, with
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:187699:188"/> such a number of Soldiers as he should think fit, to cause the Princess of <hi>Conti</hi> to depart for <hi>Eu</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out permitting her to see the Queen, or to pass through <hi>Paris;</hi> and if the Queen should design to follow the Court and to go any where else, to tell her, that he had express orders from the King, to pray her to stay to know what he should find convenient.</p>
               <p>As soon as she knew that the Court was gone <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. P. 309 &amp;c.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her, and that she was invironed with Guards, she fell into an extraordinary rage against the Cardinal; but as there was no remedy she was fain to be patient; she wrote many times to the King to justifie her self, and to lament her Condition, but the King being besieged by the Cardinal and his Creatures, would not touch them. They would oblige the Queen to go out of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne,</hi> which was judged to be too near to <hi>Paris;</hi> and to send her to <hi>Moutins</hi> in <hi>Bourbon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ois,</hi> or to <hi>Angiers,</hi> they offered her the Government of one of those two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. She absolutely refused it, and made many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties arise, which were in vain endeavoured to be taken off, because the more they desired she should change her abode, the more she obstinately resolved to stay at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne.</hi> In the mean time, they treated her openly with respect enough, and she was allowed to walk out where she pleased. They also sent the Soldiers out of the Town that she might see none of them, and that she might not seem to be a Prisoner; but they had seized on all the Avenues, to prevent the withdrawing of her self.</p>
               <p>In the interim, orders were given to the Dutchess <hi>d'Ornano</hi> and <hi>d'Elbeuf</hi> to retire from the Court; and the Mareschal <hi>de Bassompiere,</hi> without being accused of any thing else but too much complaisance to the Princess of <hi>Conti,</hi> was sent to the Bastille, where he remained till after the Death of the Cardinal, who never pardoned those who had offended him. <hi>Vantier,</hi> Physitian to the Queen-Mother, who had been one of the Principal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this Minister, was also sent to the Bastille, though the Queen demanded him; but he was promised to her on condition she would go to <hi>Moulins.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:187699:189"/>
               <p> The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had begun to make some preparatives to take Arms, and keep by force the City of <hi>Orleans,</hi> retired in the Month of <hi>March</hi> to go to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> when he saw the King approach to seise him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ready. From thence he retreated to <hi>Bezan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> in the <hi>Franche</hi> County, and the King who followed him, caused at <hi>Dijon</hi> the Count of <hi>Moret,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> of <hi>Rouannes,</hi> and of <hi>Bellegard, le Coigneux, Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurens,</hi> and all others with him, to be proclaimed Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Whereupon Monsieur sent a Petition to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris,</hi> in which he said he was gone out of the Kingdom by reason of the violent Persecution of the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who had made an enterprize on his Person, and that of the Queen-Mother; to attempt in sequel that of the King, and make himself Master of the Kingdom. He opposed the King's Declaration, and required an Act of his Opposition, as well as what he gave in form against the Cardinal. But the King <note n="*" place="margin">12 <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note> by an Arrest of Council, ordered this Petition to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed as scandalous,</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother also presented a request to the same Parliament, in which she set forth, that without doing any thing against the King or the State she was detained at <hi>Compeigne</hi> under a strict Guard. That she had always endeavoured to keep Peace between the Princes and the Grandees of the Kingdom, as well as with the antient Allies of the Crown, and to preserve the Treasury: That <hi>John Armand,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> had to the contrary, engaged the King in perpetual Wars, and had caused him to go in Person into Infected places, in the greatest heats of Summer. That he created di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusts in his Majesty against his nearest Relations, and against his most faithful Servants. She accused him moreover of other things, and required that to save her Reputation, and make her Innocence to be known to all the Realms, that they would grant an Act by which it might appear that she would be Denuntiatrix and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the Cardinal and all his Adherents.</p>
               <p>A little time after, having advice that the Mareschals <hi>Schomberg</hi> and <hi>d'Estree,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Breze</hi> were to come to <hi>Compeigne</hi> with 1200 Horse to take her away
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:187699:189"/> by force; she sought for means to make a secret flight; she departed in the Night <note n="*" place="margin">18 <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> unknown, and would have retired to <hi>La Cappelle</hi> a Frontier place of <hi>Picardy,</hi> where the Son of the Marquis <hi>de Vardes,</hi> who was Governor, had promised to receive her. But the Cardinal coming to know it, sent immediately the old Marquis thither, who put his Son out of the Place, and hinder'd the Queen's Reception there. There was a great appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that the Cardinal intended they should suffer this Princess to escape, because he knew so soon of her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>La Cappelle,</hi> to hinder her entrance there, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he would have given orders to stop her. But it was more to his advantage that she should go out of the Kingdom, than if she had staid there; and the manifest complaisance which he showed by putting the Guards at a distance, was perhaps, only to give the Queen-Mother opportunity to commit this fault which destroyed her. Be it as it will, being advertised that she could have no admission into <hi>La Capelle,</hi> and not knowing where she could be safe in the Kingdom, against the Inexorable humour of the Cardinal, she retired into <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">21 <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> From whence she wrote to the King, that she believed she had not disobliged him by retiring and delivering her self from the Persecutions of the Cardinal, and that she was gone against her will into <hi>Flanders.</hi> because she was refused entrance into <hi>La Cappelle.</hi> She was received at <hi>Brussels</hi> by the <hi>Infanta</hi> with all manner of Honours, and nothing was forgot which might alleviate part of her Griefs. But she shortly after received an answer from the King, in such terms as afflicted her very much, and which showed the extraordinary Ascendant which the Cardinal had over his Spirit. <hi>I am obliged by many proofs to the Affection and sincerity of my Cousin the Cardinal of</hi> Richelieu. <hi>The Religious Obedience which he pays me, and the faithful Care he hath in all things relating to my Person, and the good of my State, speak for him. You shall allow me, if you please, to tell you, Madam, that the action which you have done lately, and what before passed, caused me not to be ignorant what your Intentions formerly were, and what I must expect for the future: The respect which I bear you hinders me from saying any more:</hi> If this Letter were

               <p>But her retreat into the Spanish Countrys gave means to the Cardinal to make the King believe, that she had before kept correspondence with the Enemies of the State, and this Princess could never repair that fault. Thus this Crafty Minister found ways to remove from the Government, the King's Mother and Brother; nay, even to render the Queen his Spouse, suspected, and to keep the Princes of the Blood at a distance. As it was impossible that the Cardinal should design to take the Crown from the King's Head and put it on his own, and that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the other Princes of the Blood, might be suspected of such an attempt: The King diffident and credulous, became distrustful of all by the Artifices of this Minister; and after he had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ill, to believe they wished him not well; and so to regard them as secret Enemies, who wanted only a favourable opportunity to appear so. In these thoughts he could have no confidence but in his <hi>Cousin Monsieur</hi> the Cardinal, who held him thereby in perpetual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and caused him to commit all the Injustices which he would. From that time no Person came near the King but by consent of his Minister, and to tell the King what the Cardinal thought fit he should know.</p>
